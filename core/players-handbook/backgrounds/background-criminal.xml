			<p>You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Stealth</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set, thieves’ tools.</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>CRIMINAL SPECIALTY</h5>

Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.</p>

			<p>Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.</p>
