			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Command.</em></strong> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the <em>command</em> spell (save DC 15).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cone of Fear.</em></strong> While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand’s tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

			<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell’s save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn’t already.</p>
			<p class="indent">If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.</p>
