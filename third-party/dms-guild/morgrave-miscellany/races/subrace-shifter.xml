			<p>Cliffwalk shifters typically act prideful and aloof but those closest to them know these mannerisms mask a shy and introverted countenance. They prefer higher altitudes where they have ample time to gauge and react to threats. When they shift, subtle fur elongates for warmth, their senses and eyes focus acutely, and their hands and feet harden to provide greater protection against from crevice and crag. Cliffwalk shifters have the following traits in common, in addition to the traits they share with other shifters.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cloven Ascent.</em></strong> You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shifting Feature.</em></strong> While shifting, moving through difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. </p>

		<description>
			<p>Swiftwing are typically the charmers and songbirds of the shifters, usually mingling late into the morning, sometimes to the chagrin of their companions. Light on their feet and SWIMMERS_BUILD above all else, a swiftwing prizes beauty, community, and loyalty. When shifting, marrow within a swiftwing’s bone structure shifts to lighten their form and reinforce leathery webbing all over their bodies, providing aerodynamic support in the air.</p>
			<p class="indent">Swiftwing shifters have the following traits in common, in addition to the traits they share with other shifters.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma and Dexterity scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Light as a Feather.</em></strong> Your jump distance is doubled.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shifting Feature.</em></strong> While shifted, you can use your bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until you land. At the end of each of your turns, your altitude drops by 5 feet. Your altitude drops instantly to 0 feet at the end of your turn if you didn’t fly at least 30 feet horizontally on that turn. When your altitude drops to 0 feet you land (or fall), and you must use another bonus action to gain the flying speed again.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Curious, intelligent, and expressive, truedives are those shifters with no qualms about jumping right in to dubious depths. This can unnerve other shifters, but their impulsiveness is often misinterpreted. Their awareness makes the consideration of situational danger, odds of survival, and learning potential nearly subconscious, leaning their kin to predetermine the worth of such folly as much as success. As they shift, their lungs swell to help them thrive in the natural environment beneath the water.</p>
			<p class="indent">Truedive shifters have the following traits in common, in addition to the traits they share with other shifters.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Swimmer’s Build.</em></strong> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shifting Feature.</em></strong> While shifting, you can breathe underwater, you have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment.</p>
