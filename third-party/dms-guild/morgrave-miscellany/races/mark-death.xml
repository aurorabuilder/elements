			<p>TThe Dragonmark of Death is one of the great mysteries of Eberron, and it is unlikely that it will become official content or ever have an official answer. In this section, the designers present rules for using the mark in fifth edition, which intends the Mark of Death to be a useful tool as opposed to a deadly weapon, supporting the sympathetic view of the line of Vol. As always, a DM may decide to use the mark as presented here or introduce a different form of the mark to suit the campaign.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Mark of Death is designed with the assumption that the mark will reappear on a character with a blood tie to the line of Vol. While an elf makes the most logical choice, a more exotic story option might involve one of the dragonborn race. However, the DM could use the feats presented here to assign the mark to any race, or even to multiple races. As such, the ultimate approval to the prerequisites for the feats is the DM’s approval.</p>
			<h4>MARK OF DEATH TRAITS</h4>
			<p>This form of the Mark of Death only manifests on elves. If your character has the Mark of Death, this is their elf subrace.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom and Charisma scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Death’s Favor.</em></strong> When you make a Charisma ability check to interact with the dead or undead, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unliving Bond.</em></strong> As an action, you establish a telepathic link with one undead creature you touch that isn’t hostile toward you. For the next 10 minutes, the link is active while you and the creature are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the undead creature can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the undead creature gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.</p>
