			<![CDATA[<p>Morgrave Miscellany is the much anticipated supplement to Wayfinderâ€™s Guide to Eberron that comes to you by way of its co-authors Keith Baker & Ruty Rutenberg who breath more life and lore into the eponymous campaign setting now released for play with the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons. This 164 page book gives you the information you need to delve deeper into your Eberron story or character. It includes an expansive deep dive of Khorvaire from the Demon Wastes to the coasts of the Lhazaar Principalities, and a plethora of intrigue and noir story hooks in between.</p>]]>
