			<p>You’re an established reporter for a known source of news. You can often get access to restricted events for yourself and your “crew” so you can cover the story. People familiar with your work may be excited to talk to you, and even people who have something to hide may not want to turn you away without explanation. Of course, using your credentials in this way draws a lot of attention!</p>
