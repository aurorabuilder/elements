			<p>The druidic sects of Khorvaire are as organized and established as any divine faith. You have spent your life in the service of a druidic sect, serving as an intermediary between civilization and the wild. You are trained in the rituals and rites of your sect; you can offer both spiritual and practical guidance to those who follow you into the wilderness. You don’t have to be a druid, and you might not be able to perform magic, but you understand the primal mysteries of your sect, and the world itself is your temple.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose a druid sect, or work with your DM to develop a new nature focused order. The Druid section contains a sample of organizations, from the Eberron setting. Were you a youth brought up learning about the seasons and solstice from the rural priests of your homeland? Perhaps you were a warden watching over travelers, an initiate performing the sacred rites, an advisor guiding a farming community, and it is up to you to discern why you decided to leave?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Nature, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Herbalism kit</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Any one</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A druidic focus (a gift to you when you entered the sect), a shepherd’s wood staff, a set of traveler’s clothes, an herbalism kit, and a pouch containing 5 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<div element="ID_DMSG_MGMS_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_ASPIRANT_WILD_HOSPITALITY" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>You’re shaped by your devotion to the ideals of your sect and the time you’ve spent in the wilds. You have little experience with large cities and the demands of high society.</p>

			<p>As an aspirant, you can perform the rituals of your sect and can demand respect from those who share your faith. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive shelter and support in any established outpost of your sect, though druidic outposts are often sparse in what they can provide. Nature itself will also provide for you; when in the wilderness you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five people each day, provided you aren’t in an unnatural or exceptionally barren environment.</p>
