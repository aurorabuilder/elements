			<p>You don’t work with taxes or accounts. Your job is testing security systems, finding the flaws in vaults, prisons, and other secure systems. Most auditors work for the Warding Guild of House Kundarak, testing locks, traps, and other Kundarak creations. You could also have worked for the Warning Guild of House Medani, helping to spot threats before they occur. In those days, locks and wards were something you studied for your job; now you’re putting your skills to practical use as an adventurer.</p>

			<p>You have an excellent memory for traps and security structures and can always recall the general construction of such apparatus, including their triggers. You can also find blueprints of a specific trap in order to learn the details of its application. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of points of weakness, possible advancements, and magic or mechanisms that might trigger them. Your access to such information isn’t unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, your affiliation can’t shield you from the repercussions.</p>
