		<description>
			<p>You were commissioned as an officer, but you never actually made it to the battlefield. Perhaps someone pulled strings on your behalf to save you from conflict, or perhaps the war ended before you had a chance to serve. Rather than being thrown into war, you were left to choose your own path. Are you angry that you never had an opportunity to prove yourself, or glad to have dodged the front lines?</p>
			<p class="indent">When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you trained to be a part of, and what lifestyle you have led up until you began adventuring. You might have immediately pursued the lifestyle of an adventurer, served as a military advisor, or even returned to civilian life.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, History</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Navigator’s tools or vehicles (land).</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One language of your choice.</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A cadet’s uniform, a set of common clothes, a diploma from a military school, a map, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Cadets have been taught to adopt the lifestyle of a soldier, but lack both the tempering of combat experience and the physical and emotional scarring of war. These individuals who seek to fight for what they believe are often idealists and desiring to leave their impact on the world through their service to their nation or sovereign. While not true soldiers, they often embody what they envision soldiers to be.</p>
