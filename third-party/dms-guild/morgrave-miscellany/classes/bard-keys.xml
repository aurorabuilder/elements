			<p>Many say that it was a warden of House Kundarak that first mastered the techniques of the College of Keys, singing a song so beautiful that the locks of Dreadhold opened and closed with harmonious rhythm. Whatever the truth, the techniques of the College of Keys are a boon to anyone who faces locks and traps on a regular basis. Many masters of this path can be found in House Kundarak, but the elves of House Phiarlan orchestrate the Timbre Illuminous, and spies and thieves alike yearn to strike the Master Keynote. It is an uncommon path, and one that is very difficult to master, but riches await those who unravel its mysteries. </p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you can coax a variety of information from a mechanism regarding its composition using merely verse and rhyme. When you spend at least 1 minute speaking or singing to a construct or inanimate mechanism, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration to learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you two of the following characteristics of the mechanism, of your choice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Purpose (lock, trap, surveillance, etc.)</li>
				<li>Intricacy (singular, compound, or complex)</li>
				<li>Nature (magical, mundane, or otherwise)</li>
				<li>Approximate difficulty class (easy, hard, nearly impossible, etc.)</li>
				<li>Elemental energies present (if any)</li>
				<li>Additional embedded magical qualities (if any)</li>
			</ul>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 6th level, you learn to control vocal range and resonance of your voice to offset the magic or material mechanisms within security and surveillance spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you use your action to disarm or dispel a trap, or when you make a saving throw to avoid the full effects of a trap or magical ward, you can choose to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the number rolled to the ability check or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after seeing the roll but before the DM determines whether the ability check or saving throw succeeds or fails.</p>
