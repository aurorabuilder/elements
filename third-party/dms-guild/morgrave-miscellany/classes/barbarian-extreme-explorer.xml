		<description>
			<p>Some explorers search for mystical secrets, delving into the crumbling ruins of Xen’drik or climbing to the highest towers of Sharn. Some explorers venture into the frigid depths of the Frostfell or face the sandstorms of the Blade Desert in search of forgotten civilizations and ancient treasure. Whether driven by a thirst for gold, knowledge, or a love of a good challenge, the extreme explorer is an archetypal action hero, ready to face any challenge that Eberron can offer.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rather than being driven by rage, an extreme explorer is guided by remarkable luck and fueled by pure adrenaline. Every extreme explorer is a unique individual, and background helps to define their story. The adventurous Morgrave scholar could be a sage, who’s equally comfortable in a library or a jungle. A bold crypt raider might take the criminal background, reflecting a knack for dealing with traps and useful contacts when it comes to fencing recovered artifacts. An urchin born in Sharn has no interest in gold or glory, but has never met a tower that couldn’t be climbed. Most of all, an extreme explorer is an adventurer, ever ready for the next challenge.</p>

			<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, a rush of adrenaline by the thrill of inherent danger fuels your rage. While raging, you can push your body and mind, each time sacrificing your own vitality to rise to the occasion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw while raging, you can spend one of your Hit Dice to push your normal limits. Roll the Hit Die, and add the number rolled to the total. You can choose to do so after you roll your d20, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p>
			<p class="indent">Immediately after, you take damage equal to the number rolled minus your proficiency bonus, and you can’t reduce this damage by any other means.</p>

			<p>Also at 3rd level, as part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan’s tools, such as leatherworker’s tools.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, as part of a short rest, you can spend 10 minutes insulating you or your equipment against the elements. You must have access to cloth, furs, paper, plants, and other naturally occurring materials to create your insulation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you are insulated in this way, you gain resistance to cold or fire damage, and the choice you make allows you to tolerate temperatures as low as −50, or as high as 150, degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. You choose when you complete the short rest.</p>
