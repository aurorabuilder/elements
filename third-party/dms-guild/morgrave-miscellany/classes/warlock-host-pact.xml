		<description>
			<p>Your patron binds another being in its service to you in a symbiotic relationship, protecting both investments by teaming the power of its independent gifts. The nature of the symbiont and the form that you take during symbiosis depends on the nature of your patron. A fiend might pair you with an ancient evil in need of a physical form, while a Great Old One might bestow an alien symbiont, protecting you in exchange for safe haven. </p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you take damage that would reduce you below half of your hit point maximum, you can use your reaction to relinquish control to the symbiont you host and enter a state of symbiosis with it. When you do, the symbiont envelops you and your possessions with its alien essence to enhance your capabilities and protect you from harm for the next minute. While transformed, you can issue telepathic commands to the symbiont, which it tries to obey to the best of its abilities, and the following rules apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you are affected by any condition when you transform, its effect is suspended for the duration of the transformation, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that grant additional conditions.</li>
				<li>Your AC becomes your Charisma score and you add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.</li>
				<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source. Worn equipment merges with your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
				<li>You are blind but the symbiont has tremorsense, which can be used to detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within 30 feet, provided that the source of the vibrations is in contact with the same ground or substance but can’t detect flying or incorporeal creatures.</li>
				<li>You can’t cast spells or concentrate on them.</li>
				<li>Your unarmed strikes deal 1d10 magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you choose each time you make the attack.</li>
				<li>If you are knocked unconscious, your transformation ends early. As the symbiont retreats inside you, you suffer two levels of exhaustion.</li>
				<li>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while the transformation persists, the symbiont frenzies, and spends its next turn to consume the creature’s life force and takes no other actions until it does. If it consumes the creature, nothing remains, including its equipment, and the duration of the transformation increases by 1 minute and you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).</li>
				<li>You can choose to prevent its frenzy at the beginning of each of these turns with a DC 10 Charisma check to regain control using either Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. On a success, the symbiont continues to obey your commands, or you can end the transformation early. On a failure, the symbiont spends its turn to consume the creature and the DC increases by 5. You can fail each check (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) only once each transformation, and lose control of the symbiont completely when none remain. If you lose control of the symbiont while it frenzies, it becomes hostile to all creatures and spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest creature to the best of its ability until the transformation ends.</li>
