			<![CDATA[<p>The Prism bring a unique gameplay experience to the table. A prism has a pool of influence that restores at the start of each turn in combat, and increases in size steadily as they level. This influence is the fuel for their basic actions - called Projections - each turn and can be spent while using a projection to alter the emotional state of a target. This is done to both punish enemies and to bolster allies.</p><h4>The Magic of Light</h4><p>Most of a prism's magic is focused on the manipulation of light, energy, and emotions. As a prism grows in power, they specialize into an aspect of the light known as a facet--a single way of interacting with the prismatic world. Some specialize in manifesting hardened light into weapons and tools. Some seek to manipulate the ambient light of the area around them to align everyone to the same emotions. Others selfishly seek to drain the light from the world around them to bolster their own radiance.</p>]]>

        <description>
            <p>The defiant looking halfling appears shrouded in a miasma of menacing red light. As he grips his longsword in each hand, a shockwave bursts forth, engulfing the room in his light. It permeates you, leaving you with the same defiant anger you saw in him, compelling you to fight.</p>
            <p class="indent">The armored elf wields two mithril blades, a crown of golden light rests above his head as he wades into the fray. A bolt of lightning trails each strike of his sword, crashing thunderously against his foe. After the engagement concludes, a robed figure steps from behind a nearby tree. Beneath her hood glimmers a glowing gold circlet that mirrors the elven knight’s. They nod knowingly towards one another, and strike out into the night.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the goblin reveler finishes lighting a hooded lantern, a figure moves in her periphery, catching her attention. She turns the light upon the darkness to her left, though it reveals nothing . A figment of her imagination? Certainly. As she goes back on her merry way, the path she was traveling becomes engulfed in darkness, and her lantern light is snuffed out. The joy she had moments ago is siphoned away, leaving an emotionless husk with no care for self-preservation. The figure passes in front of her, giddily laughing with her stolen glee.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether they’re a furious warrior channeling their passion and rage, an impressive figure acting as a beacon of hope, or a mischievous cretin gathering all that light touches, a prism acts as a focusing crystal for the ambient energy and emotion in any situation.</p>
            <h4>THE MAGIC OF LIGHT</h4>
            <p>Inner light is both the source and product of our emotions. What defines a prism is their ability to manifest their own inner light and touch the light of others to create projections and spells. Generally speaking, a prism is a spiritual person but not devoted to a specific deity. They seek divine power from within, from the world around them, and from the light within others.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most of a prism’s magic is focused on the manipulation of light, energy, and emotions. As a prism grows in power, they specialize into an aspect of the light known as a facet--a single way of interacting with the prismatic world. Some specialize in manifesting hardened light into weapons and tools. Some seek to manipulate the ambient light of the area around them to align everyone to the same emotions. Others selfishly seek to drain the light from the world around them to bolster their own radiance.</p>
            <h4>WHERE THERE IS LIGHT, DARKNESS</h4>
            <p>Most adventurers encounter good and evil, law and chaos, and similar dichotomies in their travels. This is also true for prisms. But when they encounter light and dark it is in a very real sense. In many places of the world, manifest as both natural and magical, there are areas of absolute darkness; a place where light goes but no light leaves. This is known as a void, and to most prisms it is considered the ultimate profanity.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, not all voids are places. Often times they are concepts, such as an oppressive regime that snuffs out the will and souls of their citizens. Alternatively, some people have a void inside them that consumes the light of others in a vain attempt to feel fulfilled.</p>
            <p class="indent">A prism does not shape its life around the pursuit and extermination of such profanities, however. They are simply the yin to a prism’s yang: while both exist and recognize the existence of each other as counterparts, a balance must be maintained. Instead, a prism will often spend their life seeking to enlighten people about mastery over their inner lights in an attempt to enable the world to feel and experience to its fullest.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PRISM</h4>
            <p>When making a prism, consider how your character came to understand the nature of souls, the effects of light, and the power of magic. Perhaps your character was born into an order that teaches such discipline from birth, or experienced an emotionally enlightening event that spurred them to pursue that feeling. Perhaps, while training as a magician in the magical arts, they were enraged at a failure and conjured a devastating spell effortlessly.</p>
            <p class="indent">Did you always seek adventure, or was adventure thrust upon you by circumstance? Perhaps your birthplace was ravaged by dark forces and you seek to use your power to mend the souls of those affected and snuff out the darkness that caused it.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a prism quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the sage background.</p>
            <p><strong>Prismatic Focus</strong></p>
            <p>A focusing crystal is a key part of how a prism functions, but its appearance and shape is ill defined. In fact, it is very personal to each prism. Below are some examples of how a prism might carry their focus.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you decide on a focus, think about how your character might have come to possess it. Did they create it themselves? Was it handed down to them as a rite of completion for their training?</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Prismatic Focus</td></tr>
                </thead>

            </table>
            <p><strong>Preferred Light</strong></p>
            <p>A prism’s light is a reflection of their soul, and when manifesting light they often choose to bare a specific color to reflect their nature. If you choose to have a preferred color, consider how you came to that decision, and how others might have preconceptions about your intentions because of it.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d8</td><td>Preferred Light</td></tr>

            </table>
            <p><strong>Influencing Others</strong></p>
            <p>All prisms can use their powerful inner light to influence the emotions of others, inducing states of rage or extreme calm. Some view this as an act of aggression or manipulation. As a result, a prism may have a strict code of ethics on how and why they influence others.</p>
            <p class="indent">There are no detriments for breaking this code, but each option below provides the prism with some guidelines for such a powerful tool.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td class="col-10">d6</td><td>Influential Code of Ethics</td></tr>

                <tr><td>6</td><td>I will always return a soul to the form I found it, even if I choose to influence it</td></tr>

        <description>
            <p>As a prism, you’ve mastered the ability to project your inner light as a beam. This can be used in different ways, called Projections which are detailed below. When you use a projection, you must expend one or more influence. Influence is the power of your inner light to affect the light of others. You start with 1 influence and gain more influence as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Influence column of the Prism table. You regain all spent influence at the start of each of your turns.</p>
            <h5>PROJECTION ATTACK</h5>
            <p>As an action, make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You are proficient with this attack, and it uses your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, you roll a number of d6 equal to the influence you spend and deal that much radiant damage to the target + your Charisma modifier.</p>
            <h5>PROJECTION BARRIER</h5>
            <p>As an action, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target becomes enshrouded in a barrier of light. Roll a number of d6 equal to the influence you expended. The target gains that many temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, after rolling initiative, you can use your reaction to immediately spend up to influence maximum to project a barrier onto a creature of your choice within range.</p>

Whether you succeed or not, the target is aware of your attempt and could regard it as a hostile action.</description>

        <description>
            <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on the magic that suffuses the world around you. The prism spell list is located at the end of this document.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Prism table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your prism spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the prism spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Prism table shows when you learn more prism spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the prism spells you know and replace it with another spell from the prism spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your prism spells, since their power derives from the strength of your soul. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a prism spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>Prisms harness the light around them and the magic it holds and focus it through a glass gem known as a prismatic focus.</p>

            <p>Your soul ignites in a brilliant light. Until the spell ends, creatures that start their turn within 5 feet of you, or move to within 5 feet of you for the first time on their turn, must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their turn.</p>

            <p>You imbue your spells with the dazzling light of your soul. The next time you hit with a spell attack during this spell’s duration, roll a d8 to determine which color affects it. If you roll an 8, you can choose any of the other effects. Regardless of the result, the target takes extra damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist its effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>1. Red.</em></strong> The target becomes filled with an inconsolable rage. This attack deals an extra 3d8 fire damage. On a failed save, the target becomes enraged until the spell ends. A creature enraged this way has advantage on all weapon attacks it makes, and all attacks made against it have advantage. In addition, they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>2. Orange.</em></strong> The target becomes overjoyed and energetic. This attack deals an additional 3d8 acid damage. On a failed save, they become charmed by you until the spell ends. This effect ends early if the creature is damaged by you or one of your allies.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>3. Yellow.</em></strong> The target is overcome with a paralytic happiness. This attack deals an additional 3d8 lightning damage. On a failed save, the target becomes restrained until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>4. Green.</em></strong> The target becomes filled with disarming calm. This attack deals an extra 3d8 poison damage. On a failed save, the target loses the will to fight. A creature affected by this will immediately drop any weapons it is holding, and cannot take actions that include attack rolls until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>5. Blue.</em></strong> The target becomes overwhelmed by dour sadness. This attack deals an extra 3d8 cold damage. On a failed save, the target becomes incapacitated until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>6. Indigo.</em></strong> The target becomes consumed with an inner darkness. This attack deals an extra 3d8 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the target becomes blinded until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>7. Violet.</em></strong> The target’s mind becomes swollen with nightmarish imagery. This attack deals an extra 3d8 psychic damage. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened of you until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature that fails a saving throw against one of these effects makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.</p>

            <p>You choose a creature in range of this spell and attempt to flood its mind and soul with a series of confusing and nonsensical thoughts and feelings. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can’t be affected by this spell. A creature that fails this saving throw must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
