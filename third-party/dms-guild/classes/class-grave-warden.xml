			<p><i>Interested in livening up your D&amp;D 5e games? How do you feel about the lore surrounding life and death? Take a look at the Grave Warden, an arcane caster interested in manipulating necromantic magic!</i></p>
			<p>The Grave Warden is an intelligence-based caster obsessed with the dark arts. They specialize in spells and incantations that allow them to harness the very life-force that flows through all creatures. Where a life-force is not present, they are able to instill a mimicry of foul life, rising these dead creatures from their once peaceful earthen resting places to serve a greater purpose. Flavor of undeath oozes from this class: unholy appendages, undead servants and necromancy specialization. To obtain these gifts, the grave wardens forgo study in the other arcane disciplines (drastically reducing their spell list in favor of becoming more like the undead they keep in their company). The Grave Warden is a complete D&amp;D 5e class with four fully detailed archetypes, called requiems, that will give players unique options when creating and playing their characters. The archetypes are: Requiem of the Ash, Requiem of the Frigid, Requiem of the Haunt, and Requiem of the Torpor.</p>

		<description>
			<p>With a grimoire clutched in his right hand, the elderly human pauses as chills run down spine while he stands in the aftermath of battle. He closes his eyes to dull the noises of moans from his injured companions, as a bright light engulfs his party. His allies, living comrades and undead subjects alike, are healed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crouching on the floor of a dimly lit dungeon, a gnome reads from his grimoire while reaching into a small pouch. Pulling out a pinch of bone dust and speaking a small incantation, he blows the dust over a fallen enemy corpse from their recent battle. To the horror of his adventuring party, a spirit raises up out from the creature's chest. It lingers a moment, then heads off in the direction of its new master's outstretched arm that is pointing further into the depths of the dungeon.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young half-elf focuses on her incantation as a bilious cloud swirls around her. The pallid wind's kiss leaves soft rot on wood and sickly mold on the stone walls and floor of the dungeon. Before her, a squad of hobgoblins fall to their knees in a coughing fit, their metal armour rusting away as pustules and cysts appear on their flesh. Moments pass before the hobgoblins labour back to their feet as risen undead, staring blankly at the elf while they wait for their first command.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Grave Warden is a magic user obsessed with the study of life and death. They specialize in spells and incantations that allow them to harness the very life-force that flows through all creatures. Where a life-force is not present, they are able to instill a mimicry of foul life, rising these dead creatures from their once peaceful earthen resting places.</p>
			<h4>OBSESSION WITH THE DARK ARTS</h4>
			<p>Most practitioners of the necromantic arts share one overwhelming commonality; a lifelong search for the secrets of undeath. This search becomes an obsession for the Grave Warden, who forsake any sort of social life to study endlessly and try to quench their endless thirst for mastery of the dark arts. Those who truly wish to embrace these arts can choose a dangerous way to connect with the undead, completing an ancient and forbidden ritual hidden in the darkest tomes that mortal eyes may happen upon. They must leave the dark rooms of their studies, conquer real foes, and attain the experience necessary to truly understand a mastery of Necromancy. With that mastery, they can construct undead servants to serve along side them.</p>
			<h4>MASTERS OF THE NECROTIC MAGIC</h4>
			<p>Grave Wardens are arcane casters who draw on necromantic lore that provides a macabre power all its own. Some aspire to live forever, effectively becoming immortal. Others are fascinated with death and what happens to souls that are unable to pass into the afterlife. Some grave wardens seek to gain power through raising an army of once fallen soldiers to continue the battle once more. With this obsession to learn everything there is to know about the necromantic arts, a sacrifice happens as the grave warden becomes uninterested in other types of magic, except for a select few spells they feel can help them reach their goals faster. As a result, grave wardens have a very small subset of arcane spells to draw upon. This lack of breadth is offset by the unique abilities they gain while studying their undead subjects.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A GRAVE WARDEN</h4>
			<p>Creating a grave warden character benefits from a backstory involving an encounter with an undead creature. How did your character first come into contact with the undead? Why did you become fascinated with them? Why have you devoted large amounts of time to studying them?</p>
			<p class="indent">What then drew you forth from this life of study? Do you want to find that a specific undead creature? Maybe you want to gain a better understanding of necromantic magic? Have you received word of a sealed crypt not yet plundered? Perhaps you seek immortality and learning about the undead will help you uncover the answer to this secret.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a student of necromantic magic, you have obtained a grimoire containing spells dealing with the dark arts. At first, your ability to understand the scripture in this tome is limited.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, you are told that through devoted study and practice you will be able to decipher more of the pages, and the potency of the spells available to you will become formidable. Unlike more traditional arcane casters, you are unable to learn spells from schools of magic other than necromancy unless they are granted by your chosen requiem. See the Grave Warden Spell List on page 13 of this supplement.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the grave warden spell list. You learn additional grave warden cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Grave Warden table</p>
			<h5>GRIMOIRE</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you obtain a tome containing all of the currently known necromancy spells in the realm. There are a few blank pages at the back of the grimoire, allowing you to inscribe any requiem spells you learn during your travels when you choose which requiem path to follow.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spells that you decipher in your grimoire as you gain levels reflect the research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had while dealing with undead.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>The Grave Warden table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of necromancy spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of grave warden spells from your grimoire equal to your Intelligence modifier + your grave warden level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you're a 3rd-level grave warden you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your grimoire. If you prepare the 1st-level spell inflict wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of grave warden spells requires time spent studying your grimoire and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your grave warden spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a grave warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast a necromancy spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag, and the spell is in your grimoire. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your grave warden spells. Your <i>Undead Graft</i>, obtained at 3rd level, becomes your spellcasting focus.</p>
			<h5>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>Each time you gain a grave warden level, you are able to decipher more of your grimoire. When you gain a new spell slot level, you are able to understand and cast the corresponding level of spells if you have them prepared.</p>
			<h5>REPLACING A GRIMOIRE</h5>
			<p>Your grimoire is an ancient tome that was given to you and is thus practically irreplaceable.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, you are able to copy a spell from your own grimoire into another tome - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your grimoire. This is a lengthy and painstaking process, particularly for the spells you have not yet deciphered and used.</p>
			<p class="indent">For spells you are able to cast, coping the spell is just like scribing onto a scroll, but faster and easier, since you understand the notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp. for each level of the copied spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">For spells you cannot yet cast, the process is much more difficult. To retain the incantation's meaning, you must copy it exactly. To do so, you may make an arcana check against a DC 15 for second levels spells. This DC further increases by 2 for every additional spell level you wish to transcribe.</p>
			<p class="indent">For this reason, it is very rare for a grave warden to make copies of their grimoire; rather choosing to value it above all their other material possessions.</p>
			<h5>THE GRIMOIRE’S APPEARANCE</h5>
			<p>A grave warden's grimoire tends to don runes inlaid into a black leather cover, which symbolize the dark magic contained within.</p>

			<p><i>"Everything that grows will wither and die"</i> is the essence of all creation as understood by grave wardens, but their methods for acting upon this ideal differs greatly. Grave Wardens are able to focus their studies into different specializations, called requiems. While all grave wardens can summon the dead to fight for them, some are able to draw on life force and use it to strengthen or heal themselves and their allies, some harness winter's fury or blend in and even control the shadows and the horrifying creatures that cast light aside, while others spread decay and undeath upon their foes and effortlessly raise them as undead abominations.</p>

			<p><b>Undead Servant.</b> Your skeleton obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your servant acts on its own.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your skeleton has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
			</p>
			<p><b>Keeping Track of Proficiency.</b> When you gain your servant at 1st level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your servant's proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: ability saving throw DC, proficient skills, proficient saving throws, and attack bonus.
			</p>
			<p><b>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency.</b> For each grave warden level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.

			<p><b>Undead Servant.</b> Your ghost obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your servant acts on its own.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your ghost has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
			</p>
			<p><b>Keeping Track of Proficiency.</b> When you gain your servant at 1st level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your servant's proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: ability saving throw DC, proficient skills, proficient saving throws, and attack bonus.
			</p>
			<p><b>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency.</b> For each grave warden level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.
			</p>
			<p><b>Alignment &amp; Personality Traits.</b> Your servant shares your alignment and ideal. Its bond, trait, and flaw are decided by you upon its creation. Here is an example:
				<br/>
                <span class="feature">Bond.</span>I would gladly give my life for my beloved master.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Trait.</span>I'm dauntless in the face of adversity.
                <br/>
                <span class="feature">Flaw.</span>I tend to lose some of the bones that were used to create me, forcing my master to always search for more.

			<p><b>Undead Servant.</b> Your shadow obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your servant acts on its own.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your shadow has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
			</p>
			<p><b>Keeping Track of Proficiency.</b> When you gain your servant at 1st level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your servant's proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: ability saving throw DC, proficient skills, proficient saving throws, and attack bonus.
			</p>
			<p><b>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency.</b> For each grave warden level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.
			</p>
			<p><b>Alignment &amp; Personality Traits.</b> Your servant shares your alignment and ideal. Its bond, trait, and flaw are decided by you upon its creation. Here is an example:
				<br/>

                <br/>
