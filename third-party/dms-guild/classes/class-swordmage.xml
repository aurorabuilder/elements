		<description>
			<p>Spellsword. Battlemage. Magus. There are a lot of different names to describe characters who wield martial weapons and arcane spells in tandem. This class concept is a personal favorite of mine, and though 5e has a lot of options to bring players close to the concept (like the eldritch knight or bladesinger), neither is the true arcane half-caster that most people wish existed.</p>
			<p>My class, which I've named the Swordmage in honor of the 4e class, takes a few cues from that edition, including the strong weapon bond and the third level abilities that two of the archetypes receive. But it's also something a bit new, and borrows some mechanics from Pathfinder's magus class. While designing it I tried to keep it similar to the paladin, which many already feel is a fantastic example of a half-caster and a sort of divine sister class to what a swordmage would be. But I also tried to make it different. Instead of the ability to sense divine beings and undead, the swordmage can sense the presence of magic. Instead of getting smite, the swordmage can infuse their weapon with arcane power for extended periods, and channel the strength of full-powered spells through weapon strikes.</p>
			<p>The three archetypes presented are designed to reflect the ways I feel a weapon-bonding arcane fighter would choose to focus their abilities.</p>
			<p>The battlemage is the heavy-armored battle wizard. They are designed to take punishment and simultaneously dish it out with spell-and-swordplay, and can help their allies by making an enemy more inclined to attack them.</p>
			<p>The spellsword is more a lightly armored skirmishes, and more focused on hitting with arcanely-powered sword strikes. They are better able to strike spells into a target and can momentarily teleport to take advantage of an opponent's openings.</p>
			<p>The third archetype, the eldritch archer, can do many of the things that other swordmages can do but at a longer range. Arcane Archer is coming out as an official class in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, but for now I feel that my own "arcane archer" archetype will differ enough from the fighter archetype Wizards is releasing to justify its existence.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An elf nocks an arrow made of spectral blue energy into her bow. She takes careful aim, mutters a short incantation, and lets the arrow fly toward the group of orcs rushing towards her. The arrow slams into the lead orc, then shatters as it explodes into flames and engulfs their ranks.</p>
			<p class="indent">A human mutters words of arcane power under his breath, causing his warhammer to crackle alight with electricity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Turning the corner, he rushes toward a surprised hobgoblin with a cry, and brings the hammer down on its head with a burst of lightning.</p>
			<p class="indent">A guard shoves a captured half-elf ahead of him, leading her deeper into the king's dungeon. She quickly concentrates as the guard turns to regard another inmate, and with a flash buries her newly materialized blade into the man's back.</p>
			<p class="indent">Swordmages are practicioners of both martial combat and arcane magic. To a swordmage, fighters are uncivilized brutes whose only answer to conflict is to hit things harder, while wizards are overly delicate and more at home in a library than the battlefield. Swordmages seek to combine the best of both worlds, seamlessly merging their knowledge of the arcane into battle disciplines which no pure knight or mage could hope to achieve.</p>
			<h4>A MYSTICAL BOND</h4>
			<p>The term "swordmage" is in many respects a misnomer; the weapon employed can range from a blade to a hammer to a crossbow. What most defines a swordmage is the unshakable bond that is formed with that particular weapon. Other individuals are able to form similar arcane bonds, but the one between a swordmage and her chosen weapon goes even further.</p>
			<p class="indent">A bonded weapon is like an extension of a swordmage's own body. It is nearly impossible to rob a swordmage of it, and they are able to sense its location no matter how distant, and call it to their hand from any similar range. Some believe that each weapon contains its own minute soul, one equally capable of communicating with the Weave that surrounds everything. By forging this bond, a swordmage's capability to affect the Weave is increased.</p>
			<h4>MAGIC AND MIGHT</h4>
			<p>Without their martial training, a swordmage would still be a formidable (though much less enigmatic) wizard. The meditations and trainings they undertake allow them to comprehend the workings of the Weave, plucking at it to create varied magical effects. Many utilize their spells to augment their own martial ability, while others instead rely on them as their primary methods of combat. Regardless of the specifics, all swordmages channel magic through their weapons, needing no other focus to cast spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">Without their magic, a swordmage would still be a practiced fighter. Some spend years practicing combat styles and martial arts, learning to intimately understand the swing of a sword or the drawing of a bow. While many wizards sharpen only their minds, swordmages ensure that their bodies become as powerful a weapon as any spell.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h4>
			<p>When you create a swordmage character you should consider why you've chosen the complex path of mixing martial combat and magic arts. Were you a squire under the service of a knight who discovered a gift for magic? Were you once a wizard's apprentice, but found yourself drawn to practice with cold steel instead of properly studying?</p>
			<p class="indent">Why have you gone out into the greater world? Do you wish to prove your unorthodox lifestyle as effective as any other?</p>
			<p class="indent">Are you on a personal mission to collect some arcane secret or ancient artifact? Or perhaps you simply want to put your skills to the test.</p>

			<p>You know a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the end of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>

You can sense the presence of a magic item hidden on a person, such as in a pocket or tucked into a boot, so long as the person is not behind total cover. You cannot sense an item contained in an extradimensional space, such as in a bag of holding. You also cannot sense an object protected from divination magic, such as through the spell nondetection, or one affected by a spell such as Nystul's magic aura which hides its magical nature. A thin sheet of lead also blocks your magic sense.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you use this feature, you can select one of the magic items you sense and learn its rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, or artifact) and its magic item category (whether it is armor, a potion, a ring, a rod, a scroll, a staff, a wand, a weapon, or a wondrous item). Your magic sense has no effect on objects which bear magic but are not magic items.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
