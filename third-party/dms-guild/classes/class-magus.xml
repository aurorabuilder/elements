			<p>Combining martial prowess and magical power, the magi are spell swords, arcane archers, mystic marauders, and sorcerous sentinels. Every magus pledges themself to an eldritch society that inducts them into the magic arts and trains them in war. This versatile training means that magi are versatile adventurers and unpredictable foes.</p>
			<p>Every magus is a member of an eldritch society. Eldritch Societies included in the full version of the Magus class include: the Arcane Order, Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal, and Sideral Cabal, Shadow Court, Sylvan Circle.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">A human confronted by two orcs draws his rapier and, as he does, violet runes illuminate the air around the weapon. One of the orcs rushes towards the man, swinging its weapon wildly. As the man parries the orc’s reckless attacks, he delivers a riposte that causes the air around the orc to burst into green flames. Seeing its ally sent sprawling to the ground, the second orc becomes decidedly less enthusiastic about the fight.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">A dwarf looks down from the mountain peak she calls home and sees the rampant destruction of the woods she has sworn to protect. As she approaches the hunting encampment responsible for the fire, she calls her woodland allies to her side and her skin hardens to resemble bark.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">Looking over ancient hieroglyphs, a saurian frantically searches for details of a ritual that will fortify the mystic seal that protects his ancestral home. The impossibly heavy doors swing open behind him and he turns to face the temple’s guardians as his sword erupts with flames.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magi are mystical warriors who blend martial prowess with esoteric knowledge and spellcasting. Magi balance the pursuit of personal goals and relationships with their obligations to pursue the goals and ideals of the eldritch societies they belong to. Although their backgrounds may sometimes set them at odds against one another, magi are united by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves and a drive to master their magical abilities.</p>
			<h4>MARTIAL MAGICIANS</h4>
			<p>Every magus is a warrior. Magi train with arms and armor to protect what they hold dear, fight for what they believe in, and get themselves into or out of trouble. For magi, though violence may not be their preferred solution to a given problem, it is always a valid backup plan.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every magus is a magician. Magi use their hardearned spellcasting abilities to explore the multiverse, empower their companions, and decimate their enemies. For a magus, magic is a tool that expands their horizons and their options.</p>
			<h4>WARRIORS WITH A PURPOSE</h4>
			<p>All magi learn their abilities in order to fulfill their obligations to their eldritch society. On a mystical level, every magus’ spellcasting style is shaped by their eldritch society. On a personal level, every magus must deal with the demands and ideology of their eldritch society in their own way. Regardless of whether a magus embraces their eldritch society’s traditions and politics, no magus can deny the influence it has on their magic and outlook.</p>
			<p class="indent">Eldritch societies are not monolithic entities, but they do have beliefs and goals that the majority of the magi within them believe in and fight for. Magi in the Arcane Order observe a tradition of honoring the requests and wisdom of their mentors and, subsequently, striving to train an apprentice to become an even greater magus then they are. Members of the Primordial Seal believe that the material planes are constantly under threat of incursion from the elemental planes and they must remain on guard to ensure the world’s safety. Magi in the Sylvan Circle seek to protect the wilderness of the world from destruction and defilement, although what exactly that entails varies from magus to magus.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A MAGUS</h4>
			<p>As you create your magus character, consider the relationship your character has to their eldritch society. Does your character feel indebted to the society for the lessons it taught them? Does your character actively pursue the goals of their society? Has your character had a falling out with their society and, if so, why? While training to be a magus did you make any rivals? Who are they?</p>
			<p class="indent">Fighting may have come naturally to you and your mentor struggled to impart you with the basics of spellcasting. Or maybe the spellcasting came easily but you lacked a talent for combat. You might have spent years in training with a mentor before being left to your own devices or you may have only met your mentor informally on a handful of momentous occasions. You might report back to your society contacts regularly or keep a safe distance from other magi.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a magus quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence (Arcane Order, Shadow Court, Sidereal Cabal), Wisdom (Sylvan Circle), or Charisma (Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal) based on your eldritch society. Second, choose the Sage or Soldier background.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Aegis.</em></strong> As a bonus action you can project your mystic mark onto a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For the next minute the target is under the protection of your aegis and receives a bonus to its armor class. This bonus increases their AC by +1. If the target is wearing armor that grants a magical bonus to AC, use whichever bonus is higher. The aegis ends if you or your target end a turn more than 120 feet away from one another. A creature can only benefit from one aegis at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent">This bonus to AC increases to +2 when you reach 9th level and increases to +3 when you reach 13th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Enspell.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you surround a weapon you’re holding with your mystic mark. This weapon is enspelled and counts as a spellcasting focus for you for the next minute. While enspelled, the weapon is considered magical and adds a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. If the weapon already grants a magical bonus to attack and damage, use whichever bonus is higher. The enspell ends if you lose possession of the weapon. A weapon can only benefit from one enspell at a time.</p>

			<h5 class="caption">SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to infuse your preferred weapon or shield with magical power. Choose one of the following options.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">ELDRITCH ARCHER</h5>
			<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon under the effect of your Enspell feature you can cause the ammunition to explode with mystical energy, dealing the same damage type the attack would normally cause to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. When you do so, expend a spell slot and the creature and each other creature within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 + 1d4 damage for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d4. On a success, they take half damage.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">MYSTIC MARAUDER</h5>
			<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack with a weapon you are wielding with two hands that is under the effect of your Enspell feature, you can expend a spell slot to deal additional damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot. The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st, to a maximum of 6d6. The weapon must have the twohanded or versatile property for you to use this feature.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SORCEROUS SENTINEL</h5>
			<p>While you are wielding a shield, when a creature under the effect of your Aegis feature is attacked you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot and strengthen the target’s defenses. The target gains a bonus to AC equivalent to the spell slot expended. This bonus is only applied against the triggering attack. Additionally, the target gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier + twice the level of the spell slot expended.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELL SWORD</h5>
			<p>When you hit a creature with a one-handed melee weapon under the effect of your Enspell feature you may expend a spell slot to deal additional damage and render the creature vulnerable to magical attacks. The extra damage is 1d4 for a 1st-level spell slot. The damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st, to a maximum of 5d4. Additionally, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against spells you cast until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<p>Magi in the Sidereal Cabal consult the stars to foresee the future and intercede at moments of particular import. Once, long ago, the cabal followed a philosophy of balance, believing that destiny and free will should be given equal weight. Today the cabal is largely split into two camps, kismetists and volitionists. Kismetists prefer indirect or discrete methods when possible, believing that active and obvious interference in the world’s affairs might cause a disruption in the natural order of fate. They work to ensure that fate isn’t thwarted by powers outside its reach. Volitionists find pivotal moments where the road of destiny forks and interject themselves to force the outcome they prefer.</p>

			<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and the earth quakes threateningly beneath its feet until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly attacks a creature other than you before then, it immediately takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage as the earth rises up to rebuke it, ending the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 damage to the target, and the bludgeoning damage the target takes for attacking another creature increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level (2d6/3d6) and 17th level (3d6/4d6).</p>

			<p>This large glass bottle contains an intricately detailed sailing vessel. When the bottle is tilted such that the mouth is pointed down, the ship lists inside the bottle. Over the course of one hour the ship squeezes out of the mouth of the bottle, growing into a full-sized ship as it does so.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once empty, the bottle can be used to store any sailing vessel by placing the mouth against the ship. Over the course of one hour, the ship will shrink and squeeze into the mouth of the bottle until it fits entirely inside the bottle. Living creatures will be ejected from the ship, taking 2d10 force damage as they move to the nearest unoccupied space by the bottle. Inanimate objects aboard the ship shrink along with the vessel.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the bottle is broken while a ship is inside, the ship immediately grows to full size.</p>
			<p class="indent">When this bottle is first found, the DM chooses what type of vessel is in the bottle or determines it randomly from the options below.</p>

			<p>This magical heavy crossbow comes equipped with a pair of vials containing effervescent liquids, one orange and the other blue. Though a crossbow, this magical item cannot be used as a weapon.</p>

An aperture appears in the space you selected, as if you had cast the teleportation circle spell and created a permanent portal. Entering a portal created by the orange vial causes you to exit via the portal created by the blue vial and vice versa. If you have not created a portal with both vials, the portal does not teleport you anywhere. A portal created with this magical item remains until you use the same vial to create a different portal.</p>

			<p>This wondrous item appears as a weathered stone handbell. When rung, the bell wakens the slumbering magics of the land. The earthen bell has 12 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to ring the bell and expend 1, 3, or 5 charges to cast a spell. The spell cast is determined by the number of charges expended and the terrain you currently occupy (arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, settlement, swamp, or the Underdark). If you are not in a location that matches any of the terrain types, or you are in a location that could match multiple terrain types, your DM will decide which terrain your location counts as. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Arctic.</em></strong> Ice knife (1 charge), sleet storm (3 charges), cone of cold (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Coast.</em></strong> Purify food and drink (1 charge), water breathing (3 charges), maelstrom (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Desert.</em></strong> Create or destroy water (1 charge), wall of sand (3 charges), insect plague (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Forest.</em></strong> Goodberry (1 charge), plant growth (3 charges), tree stride (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Grasslands.</em></strong> Beast bond (1 charge), speak with plants (3 charges), wrath of nature (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mountain.</em></strong> Thunderwave (1 charge), meld into stone (3 charges), wall of stone (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Settlement.</em></strong> Charm person (1 charge), sending (3 charges), animate objects (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Swamp.</em></strong> Entangle (1 charge), stinking cloud (3 charges), contagion (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Underdark.</em></strong> Dissonant whispers (1 charge), enemies abound (3 charges), cloudkill (5 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent">The earthen bell regains 2d6 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bell cracks into many pieces and its magic is lost.</p>
