			<p>Combining martial prowess and magical power, the magi are spell swords, arcane archers, mystic marauders, and sorcerous sentinels. Every magus pledges themself to an eldritch society that inducts them into the magic arts and trains them in war. This versatile training means that magi are versatile adventurers and unpredictable foes.</p>
			<p>Every magus is a member of an eldritch society. Eldritch Societies included in the full version of the Magus class include: the Arcane Order, Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal, and Sideral Cabal, Shadow Court, Sylvan Circle.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">A human confronted by two orcs draws his rapier and, as he does, violet runes illuminate the air around the weapon. One of the orcs rushes towards the man, swinging its weapon wildly. As the man parries the orc’s reckless attacks, he delivers a riposte that causes the air around the orc to burst into green flames. Seeing its ally sent sprawling to the ground, the second orc becomes decidedly less enthusiastic about the fight.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">A dwarf looks down from the mountain peak she calls home and sees the rampant destruction of the woods she has sworn to protect. As she approaches the hunting encampment responsible for the fire, she calls her woodland allies to her side and her skin hardens to resemble bark.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">Looking over ancient hieroglyphs, a saurian frantically searches for details of a ritual that will fortify the mystic seal that protects his ancestral home. The impossibly heavy doors swing open behind him and he turns to face the temple’s guardians as his sword erupts with flames.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magi are mystical warriors who blend martial prowess with esoteric knowledge and spellcasting. Magi balance the pursuit of personal goals and relationships with their obligations to pursue the goals and ideals of the eldritch societies they belong to. Although their backgrounds may sometimes set them at odds against one another, magi are united by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves and a drive to master their magical abilities.</p>
			<h4>Martial Magicians</h4>
			<p>Every magus is a warrior. Magi train with arms and armor to protect what they hold dear, fight for what they believe in, and get themselves into or out of trouble. For magi, though violence may not be their preferred solution to a given problem, it is always a valid backup plan.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every magus is a magician. Magi use their hardearned spellcasting abilities to explore the multiverse, empower their companions, and decimate their enemies. For a magus, magic is a tool that expands their horizons and their options.</p>
			<h4>Warriors with a Purpose</h4>
			<p>All magi learn their abilities in order to fulfill their obligations to their eldritch society. On a mystical level, every magus’ spellcasting style is shaped by their eldritch society. On a personal level, every magus must deal with the demands and ideology of their eldritch society in their own way. Regardless of whether a magus embraces their eldritch society’s traditions and politics, no magus can deny the influence it has on their magic and outlook.</p>
			<p class="indent">Eldritch societies are not monolithic entities, but they do have beliefs and goals that the majority of the magi within them believe in and fight for. Magi in the Arcane Order observe a tradition of honoring the requests and wisdom of their mentors and, subsequently, striving to train an apprentice to become an even greater magus then they are. Members of the Primordial Seal believe that the material planes are constantly under threat of incursion from the elemental planes and they must remain on guard to ensure the world’s safety. Magi in the Sylvan Circle seek to protect the wilderness of the world from destruction and defilement, although what exactly that entails varies from magus to magus.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A MAGUS</h4>
			<p>As you create your magus character, consider the relationship your character has to their eldritch society. Does your character feel indebted to the society for the lessons it taught them? Does your character actively pursue the goals of their society? Has your character had a falling out with their society and, if so, why? While training to be a magus did you make any rivals? Who are they?</p>
			<p class="indent">Fighting may have come naturally to you and your mentor struggled to impart you with the basics of spellcasting. Or maybe the spellcasting came easily but you lacked a talent for combat. You might have spent years in training with a mentor before being left to your own devices or you may have only met your mentor informally on a handful of momentous occasions. You might report back to your society contacts regularly or keep a safe distance from other magi.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a magus quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence (Arcane Order, Shadow Court, Sidereal Cabal), Wisdom (Sylvan Circle), or Charisma (Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal) based on your eldritch society. Second, choose the Sage or Soldier background.</p>

			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell find familiar and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast find familiar using either slot.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5>
			<p>You know three 1st-level magus spells of your choice from your eldritch society’s spell list. You learn additional spells chosen from your eldritch society’s spell list as indicated in the Spells Known column of the Magus table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the magus spells you know and replace it with another spell from your eldritch society’s spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>
			<p>You can cast a magus spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting focus, if any, is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society to see what, if any, spellcasting focus you may use for your magus spells.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Sidereal Cabal’s spell list. You learn an additional Sidereal Cabal cantrip of your choice at 4th level and again at 10th. These cantrips count as magus spells for you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your magus spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Sidereal Cabal spells, since you learn your spells through rote study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magus spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, the effects of your mystic marks are enhanced by the Sidereal Cabal’s celestial radiance. When you place your mystic mark on an object or creature, it gives off a soft, indistinct light and hums with unseen energy.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sidereal Enspell.</em></strong> When you deal damage with your enspelled weapon you can choose to deal force damage instead of its normal damage type.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you miss with an attack with this weapon you can choose to remove the enspell from the weapon, twisting fate in your favor. When you do, you can reroll the attack with advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sidereal Aegis.</em></strong> When an attack hits a creature protected by aegis you can use your reaction to remove the aegis, turning fortune against your foe. When you do, the attacker must reroll the attack with disadvantage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 7th level, your extensive study of the stars has taught you to twist the heavenly mechanics of fate in your favor. When a creature you can see within 60 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you can use your reaction and expend a spell slot to modify the result of the roll. When you do, you can choose to either increase or decrease the result of the roll by the level of the spell slot expended. This change modifies the die result directly, not the total of the roll, which means it can turn a roll into a natural 1 or 20.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, when a creature that you can see within 60 feet makes a roll with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to seal their fate. The creature rolls three d20s, rather than two, using the highest result if it had advantage or the lowest result if it had disadvantage.</p>

When you do, roots spring from the ground and attempt to tether the target to the earth. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or it is restrained until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sylvan Aegis.</em></strong> When a creature protected by your aegis fails a saving throw you can use your reaction to remove your aegis from that creature.
