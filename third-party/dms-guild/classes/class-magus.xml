			<p>Combining martial prowess and magical power, the magi are spell swords, arcane archers, mystic marauders, and sorcerous sentinels. Every magus pledges themself to an eldritch society that inducts them into the magic arts and trains them in war. This versatile training means that magi are versatile adventurers and unpredictable foes.</p>
			<p>Every magus is a member of an eldritch society. Eldritch Societies included in the full version of the Magus class include: the Arcane Order, Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal, and Sideral Cabal, Shadow Court, Sylvan Circle.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">A human confronted by two orcs draws his rapier and, as he does, violet runes illuminate the air around the weapon. One of the orcs rushes towards the man, swinging its weapon wildly. As the man parries the orc’s reckless attacks, he delivers a riposte that causes the air around the orc to burst into green flames. Seeing its ally sent sprawling to the ground, the second orc becomes decidedly less enthusiastic about the fight.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">A dwarf looks down from the mountain peak she calls home and sees the rampant destruction of the woods she has sworn to protect. As she approaches the hunting encampment responsible for the fire, she calls her woodland allies to her side and her skin hardens to resemble bark.</p>
			<p class="indent flavor">Looking over ancient hieroglyphs, a saurian frantically searches for details of a ritual that will fortify the mystic seal that protects his ancestral home. The impossibly heavy doors swing open behind him and he turns to face the temple’s guardians as his sword erupts with flames.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magi are mystical warriors who blend martial prowess with esoteric knowledge and spellcasting. Magi balance the pursuit of personal goals and relationships with their obligations to pursue the goals and ideals of the eldritch societies they belong to. Although their backgrounds may sometimes set them at odds against one another, magi are united by their commitment to a cause greater than themselves and a drive to master their magical abilities.</p>
			<h4>Martial Magicians</h4>
			<p>Every magus is a warrior. Magi train with arms and armor to protect what they hold dear, fight for what they believe in, and get themselves into or out of trouble. For magi, though violence may not be their preferred solution to a given problem, it is always a valid backup plan.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every magus is a magician. Magi use their hardearned spellcasting abilities to explore the multiverse, empower their companions, and decimate their enemies. For a magus, magic is a tool that expands their horizons and their options.</p>
			<h4>Warriors with a Purpose</h4>
			<p>All magi learn their abilities in order to fulfill their obligations to their eldritch society. On a mystical level, every magus’ spellcasting style is shaped by their eldritch society. On a personal level, every magus must deal with the demands and ideology of their eldritch society in their own way. Regardless of whether a magus embraces their eldritch society’s traditions and politics, no magus can deny the influence it has on their magic and outlook.</p>
			<p class="indent">Eldritch societies are not monolithic entities, but they do have beliefs and goals that the majority of the magi within them believe in and fight for. Magi in the Arcane Order observe a tradition of honoring the requests and wisdom of their mentors and, subsequently, striving to train an apprentice to become an even greater magus then they are. Members of the Primordial Seal believe that the material planes are constantly under threat of incursion from the elemental planes and they must remain on guard to ensure the world’s safety. Magi in the Sylvan Circle seek to protect the wilderness of the world from destruction and defilement, although what exactly that entails varies from magus to magus.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A MAGUS</h4>
			<p>As you create your magus character, consider the relationship your character has to their eldritch society. Does your character feel indebted to the society for the lessons it taught them? Does your character actively pursue the goals of their society? Has your character had a falling out with their society and, if so, why? While training to be a magus did you make any rivals? Who are they?</p>
			<p class="indent">Fighting may have come naturally to you and your mentor struggled to impart you with the basics of spellcasting. Or maybe the spellcasting came easily but you lacked a talent for combat. You might have spent years in training with a mentor before being left to your own devices or you may have only met your mentor informally on a handful of momentous occasions. You might report back to your society contacts regularly or keep a safe distance from other magi.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a magus quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence (Arcane Order, Shadow Court, Sidereal Cabal), Wisdom (Sylvan Circle), or Charisma (Knights Stygian, Primordial Seal) based on your eldritch society. Second, choose the Sage or Soldier background.</p>

			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting ability is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society for your spellcasting ability.</p>
			<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>
			<p>You can cast a magus spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>Your spellcasting focus, if any, is determined by your eldritch society. See the Initiate feature of your eldritch society to see what, if any, spellcasting focus you may use for your magus spells.</p>

While the Order is unified in name, each member tends to operate alone or with only their mentor or apprentice—though in times of extreme circumstance, members will come together to face grave, large scale threats. Each magus of the Arcane Order takes a unique philosophical approach to their teachings, often adopting or adapting the ideals of their mentor. All scholars of the Arcane Order, however, emphasize exceptional technique and approach magic as an art to be mastered.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to replace yourself with an unlikely body double in the instant before you take a blow. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage from that attack to 1. When you do, you become invisible for 1 minute and teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice within 300 feet. You leave a block of wood or another harmless, mundane object in the space you teleported away from. You must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Magi in the Sidereal Cabal consult the stars to foresee the future and intercede at moments of particular import. Once, long ago, the cabal followed a philosophy of balance, believing that destiny and free will should be given equal weight. Today the cabal is largely split into two camps, kismetists and volitionists. Kismetists prefer indirect or discrete methods when possible, believing that active and obvious interference in the world’s affairs might cause a disruption in the natural order of fate. They work to ensure that fate isn’t thwarted by powers outside its reach. Volitionists find pivotal moments where the road of destiny forks and interject themselves to force the outcome they prefer.</p>

			<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and you knot the threads of the target’s fate with misfortune. When that creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract the result from the target’s roll.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage. This damage increases by 1d8 again at 11th level (2d8) and 17th level (3d8).</p>

			<p>You make the hand sign of paralysis and strike at a creature within range. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an unarmed strike attack against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and has a pinched nerve until the end of your next turn. If the target has a pinched nerve when you hit it with this cantrip, you deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage. While a creature has a pinched nerve, it takes 1d6 psychic damage when it takes the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the additional psychic damage and the psychic damage for taking certain actions both increase to 2d6. Both of these damages increases by 1d6 again at 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).</p>
