			<p>The Oath of the Shaklebreaker is a paladin order devoted to freeing the enslaved of their bonds – physical or magical. Shacklebreakers are particularly active where slavery or imprisonment are common, opposing the tyranny and injustice of the powerful on the weak.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Avernus Shacklebreakers often lead raids on fiend patrols, and some go so far as to try to rescue damned souls from their own chosen consequences. Particularly hated by the fiends, a Shacklebreaker’s career on Avernus is often short and glorious.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Shacklebreaker.</em></strong> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to generate an instantaneous wave of energy centred on you to a range of 30 feet, ending any effects that impose the grappled or restrained condition. Bonds break, cages open, shackles are released, magical spells or effects that impose the condition are dispelled, and even creatures physically grappling are forced apart.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Surge of Will.</em></strong> As an action you can use your Channel Divinity to redouble the will of friendly creatures. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet are granted advantage on and Wisdom or Charisma saving throws until the start of your next turn, and any creatures under the effects of the charmed condition are immediately allowed a new saving throw to end the effect.</p>
