			<p>Hell Guides are a conclave of rangers dedicated to providing safe passage across Avernus and other layers of the Nine Hells. Aside from this principle, no two Hell Guides are alike. Motivations can range from the desire to personally conquer a dangerous frontier, to altruistically guiding the lost or endangered out of harm's way, to selfishly exploiting their talents to extract coin or other bargains from the desperate or foolish.</p>

			<p>Starting at 7th level you have become acclimatized to the Nine Hells to the extent that you are almost as comfortable as a native. You are immune to any effects from the environment of the plane that induce exhaustion, and have advantage on saving throws versus other effects (such as Styx water contact or alignment shift). You are treated as aligned to Lawful Evil and as a Nine Hells native for the purposes of spells and abilities (for example, you are not permanently banished by a banishment spell) regardless of your actual alignment or plane of origin.</p>

			<p>At 15th level your will to survive and personal experience have hardened you to battle against some of the most vicious creatures in existence. You will throw dirt, spit, curse, plead and use any and all tactics at opportune moments to distract a foe. As a reaction you may employ these tactics against a creature attacking you, gaining a +3 bonus to AC against all attacks made by them against you on their turn.</p>
