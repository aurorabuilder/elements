			<p>Soul Gatherer clerics roam the Hells, gathering souls that are lost, bound or enslaved. Some do this out of altruism, seeking to assuage the tormented soul and liberate it, while others collect souls out of a lust for power or control, seeking to dominate their spirit captives. Untethered spirits are naturally attracted to the aura of a Soul Gatherer, gathering in their wake. Anyone viewing a Soul Gatherer that can also see into the ethereal can make out a swarm of the incorporeal creatures crowding the cleric like a school of ectoplasmic fish. Others are connected to the Soul Gatherer by the cleric’s possession of their bound object, such as a soul coin or other receptacle, able to manifest due to the Cleric’s unique abilities.</p>
