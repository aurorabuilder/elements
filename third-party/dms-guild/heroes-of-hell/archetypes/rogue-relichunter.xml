			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a talent for sifting worthwhile objects from junk. You can automatically gauge the relative value of any object in gold pieces, and add a bonus to your Perception and Investigation skill checks equal to half your level (round down), but only with regards to finding, identifying and separating out hidden or concealed objects of value from other objects (such as battle debris or junk piles). This does not allow you to find deliberately hidden objects in crafted concealment (such as secret compartments or passages).</p>

			<p>At 6th level you may attune to a magical item by tinkering with it for 1 minute rather than the usual hour required. This ability does not confer knowledge of the item before attunement, and does not protect you from any adverse effects—such as curses—of attunement.</p>
