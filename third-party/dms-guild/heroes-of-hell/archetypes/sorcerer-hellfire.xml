			<p>At 1st level you gain access to a metamagic ability that allows you to alter the elemental composition of your spells. By expending Sorcery Points equal to the spell’s level, you may change the damage type of any spell that deals fire, cold, lightning, acid or poison into hellfire, which deals half fire, half necrotic damage (round fractions down). This metamagic ability may be used in conjunction with another metamagic ability, assuming you have adequate sorcery points available.</p>
