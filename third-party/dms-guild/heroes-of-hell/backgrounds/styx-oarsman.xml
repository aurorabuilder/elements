			<p>You found yourself poling a small skiff on the black waters of the Styx. You have no idea how you came to be a barge pilot, and little else about your past save a few tattered, disjointed memories. You carry a trinket from your past, but it means nothing to you.</p>

				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Perception</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Vehicles (water)</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Infernal</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A long oar, a random trinket (chapter 5 of the PHB) tied to your past, an infernal work permit (a flayed skin scroll), a set of ragged clothes, and a belt pouch with 10 gp.</li>

			<p>You have been exposed to the memory stealing properties of the waters of the Styx so many times you have actually developed a slight resistance to memory altering effects - not to mention there's very little left to alter. You have advantage on saving throws against spells or abilities that alter or affect your memory. This includes exposure to the waters of the river Styx.</p>
