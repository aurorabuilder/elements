			<p>You are a survivor of the slave blocks of Darkspine on Avernus, or Dis, the Iron City, having managed to escape your servitude as a slave. You know how to pick a lock, hide and scrounge, surviving on the barest minimum to get by in the blasted landscape of Hell and the back alleys of its hateful cities. You know how to spot a slaver, and have a finely tuned will to live.</p>

			<p>You are able to find enough food and water for yourself and up to 5 other people to survive whilst in Hell – though often is it unpleasant or unpalatable. You are also able to always find or cobble together a rudimentary set of tools for any trade from scraps, cast offs and detritus. These are poor tools, and any checks with them are made at disadvantage.</p>
