			<p>Mortals do frequent hell for various reasons - adventurers, crusaders, merchants, slavers, slaves and ...lawyers. You were born in Hell, your parents belonging to that very limited group that reside on the lower planes. Life is tough, but not impossible, for mortals here, but with the right knowledge and a little luck some survive long enough to make a go of it. Your time here has hardened you, and you are wise to the plane's dangers.</p>
