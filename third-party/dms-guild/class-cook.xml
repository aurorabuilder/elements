    <description>
      <p> A half-orc throws a perfectly seasoned chicken leg at his dwarven friend, lands it directly in her mouth. As a horde of goblins charge the dwarf, she begins nibbling, her arms swell, and she swipes away three of the charging goblins with a single swipe of her shield. The half-orc wipes his greasy hands on his apron and smiles.</p>
      <p class="indent">A halfling stares a dragon down over a mile of open field. As the dragon inhales deeply, she pulls out a roasted pepper and chomps down. She begins to sweat profusely. The dragon breathes fire, and the halfling charges straight on through.</p>
      <p class="indent">A human mixes the contents of a boiling pot and looks around at all his friends, tired and spent, but he’ll see to it that that doesn’t last too long.</p>
      <p class="indent">Cooks are the much-forgotten caretakers of every band of heroes, for a dragon-slaying cook can always die of hunger. Through tasty foods cooks strengthen their allies and debilitate their foes, commanding incredible control over any battle.</p>
      <h4>FOOD AS A CRAFT</h4>
      <p>Anyone can throw meat atop a fire, but only cooks can make that meat sing. Just as an artist can watch a child paint their house, so too does the cook look at the typical kitchen. They may laugh or smile or even snarl at the naivety presented, but they all recognize it as simple, basic. Meals are more than a collection of ingredients to a cook.</p>
      <p class="indent">Every creature is suffused with the same magical energy that binds the multiverse together. Cooks have, knowingly or unknowingly, learned to tap into the magic of creatures through food, the source of their vitality, and cooks use their craft to shape it.</p>
      <p class="indent">Their talents put cooks above the common people, and that’s where you’ll find them: Some traveling with adventurers who’ve wrestled with giants, giving those adventurers the power to succeed. Some see their bodies as test subjects, formulating dietary plans to improve themselves beyond the normal limits of their species. Some even find a way to take advantage of the senses, and create food that is not meant to improve but to hinder, to weaken, to destroy. Cooks understand how finely tuned a body is, especially once you get inside it, and they know how to make or break it.</p>
      <h4>A LIFE OF SERVITUDE</h4>
      <p>Cooks are on a constant search, a search for the perfect flavor, the best diet, the choicest ingredients. The meeker ones find employ with wealthy manors or in gritty taverns, but the ones with ambition know that their search could not end in a stuffy kitchen beholden to the bland tastes of big wigs and commoners.</p>
      <p class="indent">Bold adventurers come with bold tongues, and they are the only hope of an end to a cook’s journey. True cooks offer their services only to those proven worthy of the food they will prepare. Adventurers rip the essence out of life, and cooks take that essence and throw it in their pot. Cooks will keep these adventurers alive and fed until their personal quests find completion.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A COOOK</h4>
      <p>As you create your cook, keep in mind how your character got into the gourmet arts. Were they a hired hand that learned too quickly in the kitchen and developed an insatiable ego? Were they taught by a family member or a close friend and thus have a sentimental approach to their craft? Were they thrust into cooking out of necessity, living on their own in harsh conditions trying to squeeze vitality out of their barren surroundings?</p>
      <p class="indent">A cook may begin their culinary studies in family kitchens or tiny inns, but they will soon realize that to progress means to move on from these dead ends. Most cooks will find employ with adventurers, allies that the cook can trust for safety and for feedback. Every great cook needs a couple of critics.</p>

      <p>At first level, you craft a Cook's Bag, a bag that magically preserves not only your morsels, but also the ingredients required to make them. You must replenish these ingredients at least once every 30 days. When you do so, you can buy 10 gp worth of food from a market, or you can spend 8 hours scavenging food from your surroundings. If you lose this bag, you can create a new one by expending 100 gp worth of leather, gems, and other raw materials. Doing so takes 8 hours of work.</p>

  <element name="Morsel" type="Class Feature" source="Sam Grierson" id="ID_DMSG_CLASS_FEATURE_COOK_MORSEL">
    <description>
    <p>Years of cooking have taught you that every meal has that one perfect bite, a morsel where all the ingredients mix together into something truly special. You have learned how to instill this morsel with magical effects dependent on the ingredients of the morsel. Creatures that ingest your morsels are given these effects.</p>
    <p>Choose three morsels of your choice. These are the morsels that you can prepare. A creature can only be under the effects of one morsel at a time. If a creature is under the effects of a morsel, and they ingest another morsel, the original effect ends. You learn how to prepare additional types of morsels as you level. Each time you gain a level, you can replace one morsel you know with a different one.</p>
    <p>You can cook a number of morsels equal to your Constitution modifier every short or long rest. You can cook the same type of morsel more than once. All morsels are stored in your Cook’s Bag and expire if taken out for longer than 6 seconds, or the next time you cook morsels. You can use your action to feed a morsel to a creature. When you do so, you reach into your Cook’s bag, pull out a morsel, and feed it to a conscious creature you can touch. They ingest it immediately. You must have a free hand to feed a morsel.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Morsel save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
    </p>
    <p>Creatures who do not have mouths or analogous orifices can still be affected by your morsels. Mere contact with your morsels imparts a weakened effect. If a creature cannot ingest your morsel, it has advantage on any saving throws it makes against the morsel's effect.</p>

If the creature has made a saving throw against one of those conditions, they can repeat that saving throw immediately, ending the condition on a success.

      <p>Most cooks stumble upon the physical power of vitality, or perhaps they simply feel its power in their gut. Monster Mashers cannot stand this ignorance and thus become determined to study the vitality that gives their morsels power. They study all kinds of life, and are always happy to experiment on the living and the dead.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, you learn that there is a power left in creatures recently killed. During their last moments, the threat of death brings a creature to full and utmost life. The vital essence of a creature killed in this state lingers, but must be harvested and preserved to be utilized.</p>
      <p>If you or an ally kills a hostile creature with a challenge rating of 1 or higher, and the creature's body is not destroyed, you can harvest meat from the body for a special meal if it is of a type you know how to cook (described below). Harvesting this meat takes 1 hour, and you have 24 hours after killing the creature to harvest the meat before the vital essence fades. You keep this meat in your Cook's Bag until you are ready to prepare it. You can only have one of these meats in your Cook's Bag at a time. As part of a short or long rest, you can prepare the special meal from this meat. A number of creatures equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier can partake of the meal as part of the same short or long rest. These creatures gain a benefit depending on the creature type of the creature from which the meat came. This benefit lasts for 24 hours after the short or long rest ends, or until your next long rest, whichever comes first. Beast. Your current and maximum hit points increase by 10.</p>
