			<![CDATA[<p>As featured on D&amp;D Beyond, this supplement introduces additional feats that allow you to explore your character’s race further. These feats are each associated with a race from sources outside the Player’s Handbook, as summarized in the Racial Feats table below.</p><p>As with the feats found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, using these racial feats means that your connection with your race’s culture has deepened or something more dramatic has happened, such as a physical transformation through age, powerful magic, or a spectacular event in your campaign.</p>]]>
