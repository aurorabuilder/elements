            <p>In an era long before mortal reckoning, the Living Gate, the only bastion of safety against the nightmare creatures of the Far Realm, was torn apart in an unimaginable cosmic catastrophe.</p>
            <p>You weren’t there, of course. It was well before your time.</p>
            <p>Still, its shards make up your body. Its ancient thoughtforms shape your mind. And your life carries on its legacy.</p>
            <p>Shardminds are a race of psionic crystal, constructed from the remnants of the last safeguard against the Far Realms. Strange and unearthly, shardminds are nevertheless guided by an unerring purpose: to cleanse the world of aberrations, and to make the multiverse once again safe from the madness that plagues it.</p>
            <p>Do you quest after the secrets of the multiverse, hoping to reconstruct the Living Gate? Do you seek to become as powerful as you can, to be a better safeguard than the Gate ever was? Or do you hunt down any that threaten the realm, and those that stand in the way of the Gate’s reconstruction?</p>
            <p>Your life is your own, and your destiny is clear as crystal.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Formed after the destruction of the Living Gate, a divine construction that once imprisoned the worst horrors of the multiverse, shardminds are beings of psionic power animating the crystal shards that make up their form. Each shardmind that awakens continues the legacy of the Living Gate, however they may choose to do so.</p>
            <h4>CRYSTALLIZED THOUGHT</h4>
            <p>Each shardmind is composed of the sentient, crystalline pieces of the Living Gate, and typically have a green, white, amber, or red coloration throughout their whole body. Shardminds stand roughly 6 feet tall and weigh about 180-230 pounds.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a shardmind awakens from its constituent crystal shards, it fashions itself a form best suited for interaction with the world. As such, shardminds have a humanoid shape, yet have nearly-featureless faces with two glowing eyes which gently emit a psionic radiance from within. Though shardminds have no need for colthing, they sometimes adopt rudimentary garb made of simple, unadorned fabrics.</p>
            <h4>LOGIC AND EMOTION</h4>
            <p>When it existed, the Living Gate was composed of sentient thoughtforms as much as actual, crystal matter, designed to be an effective safeguard against the nightmare creatures of the Far Realms. The Gate was always able to shift forms, or to intuitively ad opt new strategies to counter the insidious forces that would try to break through.</p>
            <p class="indent">These thoughtforms live on inside shardminds, end­lessly reincarnated and mixed about when one shard­mind dies, and another cluster of forgotten shards ani­mates. Every animated shardmind is a new individual, and each experiences the world diff erently. </p>
            <p class="indent">As creatures of psionic energy, shardminds trend towards both logical thought and emotional extremes. Shardminds can seem calculating and emotionless at first, but they simply do not experience smaller emotions. A shardmind is never merely irritated, saddened, or con­tent, and they only show emotion once they are outraged, sorrowful, or overjoyed.</p>
            <h4>INHERITORS OF THE GATE</h4>
            <p>Each shardmind carries within it an ancestral memory of the Living Gate, and holds at least a small motivation to continue its purpose. This can take many forms, and each shardmind has a distinct approach to how they continue the Gate's legacy.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some shardminds simply hunt aberrant creatures of the Far Realms wherever they may be found, while others journey to collect pieces of the Gate that have not yet awakened, in hopes of rebuilding it. Many simply focus on improving their prowess, knowing that their power is the Gate's power. And yet other shardminds, spoken of in whispers, maraud in search of other shard­minds to kill, reckoning that only when every shardmind is dead, will the Living Gate be reformed.</p>
            <h4>SHARDMIND NAMES</h4>
            <p>Shardminds tend to name themselves, often choosing names that match the auditory emanations of the psionic field that binds their individual form together. As they create themselves in the rough image of other living beings, shardminds can have any gender identity (or none at all), and yet do not have a biologica} sex. Regard­less, shardmind na mes do not fall along gen der lines. </p>
            <p><strong>Names:</strong> Aahoraa, Alarr, Bruaa, Crendx, Freen, Haum, Jjrin, Kylax, Lvivv, Mrrn, Olo, Qiin, Rrixx, Siliuss, Triniv, Urivuu, Viun, Xyll</p>
            <h4>Shardmind Traits</h4>
            <p>Your shardmind character has the following racial traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your choice of either your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> As a construct, you do not age in a traditional sense and can not die of old age.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Shardminds are typically born into the world as a moral blank slate, and trend strongly towards neutrality. However, the opposition of the form er Living Gate to the chaos of the Far Realms also causes many shardminds to lean towards being lawful.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> The concentration of psionic crystal necessary to create self awareness results in a roughly human-sized form. You are size Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You cannot speak without using telepathy, but you can understand, read, and write Common, Deep Speech, and one other language of your choice. </p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> You can communicate via two-way telepa­thy with any creature that is within 30 feet of you, if that creature knows at least one language.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Living Construct.</em></strong> The psionic crystal that makes up your form is both inorganic and yet imbued with life. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Additionally, you have two creature types: humanoid and construct. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types. </p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Resonance.</em></strong> You can use verbal components of spells, even if you do not speak, which manifests as a resonant, audible humming of your constituent shards. You can be affected by silence and similar as usual. </p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Crystalline Body.</em></strong> You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> Your crystalline form is naturally resistant to being damaged. Your AC cannot be less than 14, but armor, spells, and other effects can make it higher.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Luminescence.</em></strong> Your shards glow with a soft inner radiance, and you naturally cast dim light in a radius of 5 feet around you. You can intentionally stifle this light and turn it off, or turn it back on, by using a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shard Swarm.</em></strong> On your turn, you can use a bonus action to break your body into its constituent crystals and then teleport to an unoccupied location you can see within 15 feet. Choose up to 3 creatures within 5 feet of your original location. The first attack made against each creature before the end of your next turn is made with advantage. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
