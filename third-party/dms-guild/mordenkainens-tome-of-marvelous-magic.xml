			<p>This item consists of a 2-foot-long central iron shaft with an upper crosspiece and two curved bars at the base. Attached to it is a 4-foot length of stout, coarse rope.

The rope magically lengthens until the anchor touches bottom or the rope reaches its maximum length of 1 mile. If you use an action to speak the command word again, the rope shortens back to its original length.</p>

			<p class="indent">Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to the bellows.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which you are pointing the bellows.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you place this item on your wrist, you gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with one beast of your choice. A side effect is that you can no longer speak any other language, but can only make the noise, such as a bark or meow, of the last beast you spoke to. This effect lasts while you have the bracelet on your wrist.</p>
			<p class="indent">The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.</p>

			<p>This item resembles a multi-faceted yellow diamond and is about 2 inches across. You can use an action to throw the globe up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the globe detonates in a 40-foot-radius sphere of brilliant sunlight. The globe is consumed when it detonates.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each creature in that light must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature blinded by this effect makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.</p>

			<p>This lamp is made from black iron and has shutters. It does not consume any oil. When you unshutter the lamp, magical darkness spreads out from it to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for 10 minutes. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this property of the lamp can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This brass oil lamp is engraved with palm leaves and always appears tarnished when found. When you rub the lamp, you summon a <strong>djinni</strong> from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears to emerge from the lamp spout as a stream of colorful smoke and materializes in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
			<p class="indent">The djinni remains with you for a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane. While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The djinni may be summoned up to three times. After the third summons, the lamp randomly teleports somewhere up to 1000 miles away.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This item appears to be an ordinary green leaf, freshly picked from a tree. You may command it to detect either a species of creature (such as goblins) or a type of creature (such as fiends or aberrations).

It returns to green once it is no longer within 120 feet of the creature. The leaf can only be attuned to detect one species or type of creature every 24 hours.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This mask is made of white plaster and depicts a face with holes for the eyes and mouth. When you use an action to don this mask, you make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different for 1 hour or until you use your action to take the mask off.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can seem 2 feet shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The changes wrought by this item hold up to casual physical inspection. For example, if you use this item to add a hat to your outfit, anyone touching the hat believes that they feel it. However, anyone making a detailed physical inspection of your appearance and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discerns that you are magically disguised.</p>
			<p class="indent">The disguise lasts up to 1 hour and the mask may be used as many times as you wish.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This pipe is always magically full of fresh tobacco. When you use an action to light and puff on it, you create a 20-foot-radius sphere of thick grey smoke centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature other than yourself that is completely within the smoke at the start of its turn must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">The smoke lasts for one hour or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Once you have lit the pipe, it can’t be lit again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This 5-foot-long pole is made of polished steel. When you speak the command word, a short silver thread appears attached to the end of the pole, with a 6-inch-wide silver hoop on the end of the thread. If you make a casting motion with the pole toward a creature you can see within 120 feet of you, the hoop flies unerringly toward the target with the thread magically lengthening. If the target, being of size medium or smaller and not magically restrained, takes hold of the hoop, the thread begins retracting and drags the target toward you. Speaking the command word again causes the thread and hoop to disappear.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once used, this property of the pole can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
