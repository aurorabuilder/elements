			<p>In cursed lands, forgotten tombs, and ancient temples to dead gods, the undead hold court, waiting to fell any traveller foolish enough to venture beyond the world of the living. </p>
			<p>You are not like the others, however. Though your curse may be the same, within your mind dwells a shadow of the mortal soul you once had, a glimmer of hope, a flicker of self awareness. Your former life is over, the lands and loves you have known as dead and buried as you should have been. </p>
			<p>And yet, you live on. Who raised you? What did they raise you for? And for what greater purpose do you continue to struggle, even after death has claimed you as its own? </p>
			<p>The <strong>Awakened Undead Character Race</strong> includes rules for playing undead characters of all descriptions, from lowly skeletons to ravenous ghouls, spectral ghosts, vengeful revenants, and cursed mummies. This race utilizes who you were in a past life to continue to color your character, and unifies all awakened undead under a series of shared character traits. </p>
			<p>Will you attempt to rebuild what was lost, or seek retribution against those that took it from you? Will you strike forward as a mournfully misunderstood hero, or a vile, wholly-justified villain?</p>
			<p>Your life is over now, and who you were no longer defines you. Now, who will you become?</p>

        <description>
            <p>Death comes for all things in a near-infinite variety of ways. So, too, are there many reasons that the dead might return from the grave. Directly-applied necromancy, cursed lands, and unfinished business are but a few, and all leave the newly-undead soul with a mere semblance of the life it had before. All undead carry the physical or emotional scars of what ended their mortal lives, though some may be far more subtle than others.</p>
            <h4>DEAD AND REBORN</h4>
            <p>Typically having no lands to call their own, undead with an awakened sense of self are usually perpetual foreigners, wanders in a land and often a time not their own. Compounding matters, most mortal cultures carry within them an instinctual fear of death and the dead, and many associate necromancy specifically with dark tidings. This forms a wall of (often well-earned) prejudice and hatred that sentient undead find themselves up against, and many undead choose to hide their necrotic natures behind clothes, masks, and pungent perfumes when journeying into civilization.</p>
            <p class="indent">Depending on composition, humanoid undead typically range a wide gamut from 20 to 300 pounds, and may possess empty eyes, a colored flame-like magical animus in their sockets, or harrowed, surprisingly mortal eyes burning with an inner fire. Hair (if they have it at all) is usually lank, dark, and wrought with grime and grave-dirt that no amount of cleaning will fully remove.</p>
            <h4>SERVICE AND FREEDOM</h4>
            <p>Undeath is effectively immortality, a strong reason why many mortal spellcasters of a certain moral bent consider it a viable alternative to actually dying. Still, it is not immortality without a price; senses and emotions dull, food and drink no longer have taste, and often an undead state comes alongside a subservience of will and unthinking toil beneath a master who likely does not have the world’s best intentions at heart.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some undead are born into freedom, while others earn it or have it thrust upon them. Regardless, all undead that have freedom greatly cherish it, as the reminders of what could easily happen were they not fortunate enough to possess free will abound throughout history. Many consider it their sacred duty to free other mindless undead, or simply to dispatch them wherever they may be found. The reasoning is straightforward enough: a final rest awarded to all mortals is greatly preferential to eternal slavery to the likes of a short-sighted, megalomaniacal spellcaster.</p>
            <h4>FALLEN HOME, FORGOTTEN PAST</h4>
            <p>For many awakened undead, the past is a distant homeland to which they may never return, holding names and faces now partially-forgotten, and loves and lives as dead as they are. The anguish of this loss is enough to drive many mad, but others use this rage and pain as a source of power and drive, carrying them further on the road to whatever dark destiny awaits.</p>
            <p class="indent">Frequently, entire countries, customs, and cultures an undead may be familiar with no longer exist, and the sentient dead behaves or speaks in an antiquated fashion because of this. It may be even more difficult than usual for such undead to relate to more modern mortals, and typically these undead leverage what companions they may have to bridge this epoch-long communication gap. </p>
			<h4>UNDEAD NAMES</h4>
			<p>Many undead that awaken into sentience prefer to keep the names they held in their mortal lives. For others, however, their mortal names are forgotten or have lost meaning. These undead often adopt nicknames given to them by their former masters or present companions, and hold them to be as true as any other creature’s birth name.</p>
			<p class="indent">Examples of names given in this fashion may be seen, below:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Names:</strong> Rattlebones, Spore, Rotface, Raven, Bane, Carver, Drudge, Rook, Mort, Pale, Minion, Crumble, Shade, Wisp, Clatter, Shiver</li>
			</ul>
            <h4>AWAKENED UNDEAD TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your Undead character has the following traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Constitution score increases by 1. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>You do not age. Given time, the necromantic energies that sustain you will heal most wounds you take at approximately the same rate as a mortal, and your hit dice function as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Many awakened undead cling to the alignment they held in life. For others, death changes them significantly, and they adopt a new worldview in light of what their death has taught them.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Past Life. </i></b>Choose another race besides this one, which must be humanoid and lack the Living Construct trait (or similar). Before your death, you were a member of this race and appear as an undead version of it. Your size, height, and movement speed are the same as a typical member of that race. You do not retain special movement speeds from this race (such as swimming or flying). If your Past Life race has subraces, you can select one, but it confers no benefits. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision. </i></b>Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity that which lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Living Dead </i></b>You have been raised from death, but regaining your autonomy has returned to you some of the spark of life. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Additionally, you have two creature types: humanoid and undead. You can be affected by a spell or ability if it works on either of your creature types. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Restless. </i></b>As an undead, you very rarely tire. You treat exhaustion as if it was one level less. In addition, instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Unholy. </i></b>Unlike other undead, you can be restored through healing magic, but it has a significantly dampened effect on you. When you regain hit points from a source that specifies it does not function on undead, you only receive half as many hit points as the source would normally provide, rounded down.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Bloodless. </i></b>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Subrace. </i></b>Five types of awakened undead are available to you. Choose Skeleton, Revenant, Ghost, Ghoul, or Mummy, listed in the following section.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language, typically one available to the race you chose for your Past Life. If your Past Life race has a trait that precludes speech (such as a kenku’s Mimicry), you are still not able to speak and instead gain access to the relevant trait of your Past Life race that substitutes speech.</p>

			<p>An animated figure made of dry bones devoid of flesh and muscle, you were likely raised by a necromantic caster or dark, supernatural curse as a simple minion, completely without will and self knowledge. Something changed, however; perhaps your master was slain, the land cleansed, or you merely awoke one day to fragmented memories of your previous life. Whatever the case, possessed of a fledgling sense of self and newfound purpose, you struck out into the wider world to find a new destiny.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity or Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bone Pile.</em></strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. If you do, you reduce yourself to a pile of bones, render yourself prone, and are considered to be under a similar effect to the feign death spell. While subject to this condition, you are unable to move or take actions other than using an action to end this effect. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Them Bones.</em></strong> Whenever both of your hands are unoccupied, you can use a bonus action to rearrange the bones in your body, or to return your body to its original configuration. Some rearrangement options for example:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><b>Bone Club.</b> You remove an arm and use it as a bone club. While used as a weapon, you have proficiency with your removed arm, which is a melee weapon with the finesse property that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.</li>
				<li><b>Bone To Pick.</b> You remove a hand, and hold it in your other hand as if it were a set of thieves’ tools. This hand is capable of picking locks, cutting glass, and any other function thieves’ tools could achieve.</li>
				<li><b>Bone Xylophone.</b> You remove two of your ribs and use the rest of your remaining ribs as a musical instrument.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At your DM’s option, you can use this trait to perform other tasks, such as juggling your own bones, removing your skull to look around a corner or over a wall, or similar. Your bones lose their animation if they are further than 5 feet from the majority of your body, and must be reattached before they are once again a part of you. If your skull loses animation, you are blinded and deafened until a skull is affixed to your body.</p>

            <p>When a brutal murder or an atrocious crime slays an innocent soul endowed with sufficient willpower, there are rare occasions where the victim refuses to stay dead. You were not created at the whim of a mortal spellcaster. Rather, either a god interceded in your death, or you had too much willpower to give into death. This usually occurs at least a full day, though sometimes centuries, after your death occurred.</p>

            <p>Lingering souls of the dead and departed, ghosts are raised as servants by potent necromancers or hold onto the world themselves when there is unfinished business they have yet to accomplish. If a ghost is charged with unfinished business it can take many forms, from protecting a loved one, to keeping a particular item safe, to simple revenge. Ghosts are spectral and luminous, but are usually solid to the touch unless they expend conscious will to be otherwise. Thus, a ghost can interact with objects as mortals do. All ghosts carry obvious and sometimes twisted marks of what caused their death, which are often quite disturbing to all but the most jaded mortals. </p>

            <p>For all the arguable benefits it offers, some souls seek out the gifts of undeath, sacrificing their mortality for a chance at ever-greater power. Necropolitans are oncemortals who have undergone the ritual of Crucimigration, a painful process that strips them of their mortality and replaces it with a dark necromantic energy. A necropoplitan’s skin tightens and bleaches or becomes ashen, and the irises of their eyes pale to a frosty blue-white. </p>
            <p class="indent">Crucimigration itself has similarities to certain paths to lichdom, and rumor has it that becoming a necropolitan can be the first step towards transforming into a lich, gradually and free of the terrible sacrifices usually involved in such a process. Stories also abound of a mysterious city named Nocturnus, hidden away and filled with the undead, where necropolitans rule throngs of mortals that aspire to become as undead as their masters.</p>

As a ritual that takes 24 hours to complete, you can designate as your phylactery one non-magical object on your person worth at least 2,500 gp that you can hold in one hand. Once the ritual is completed and you have made an object your phylactery, you cannot perform this ritual again until 300 days have passed. Conducting the ritual again after this time causes your initial phylactery to become mundane once more, and the new object becomes your phylactery.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your phylactery has 30 hit points, an AC of 18, and immunity to all damage except radiant and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage done by silvered weapons. If you die while your phylactery exists, and you are on the same plane as your phylactery, you reform adjacent to your phylactery after 24 hours. If you are resurrected by some other means before this time, you do not reform via your phylactery. When your phylactery has you reform, a new body is created for you, and your old body disintegrates into dust. The objects and clothing on the person of your old body are unaffected, but your new body is formed without any of the objects your old body possessed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have reformed with your phylactery, you cannot do so again for 30 days. If you die within this time, your phylactery will not reform you, though you can still be resurrected by other means.</p>

            <p class="indent">Further, in place of one of the attacks you would make with the Attack action, you can utter a blasphemous word, causing your bandages to spring to life and wrap around a Large or smaller creature you can see within 15 feet of you. That creature makes its choice of a Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of one of your modifiers out of either Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma. If the creature fails this check, it is grappled by you. This grapple does not occupy a hand. You can only have one creature grappled in this way at a time, and checks a creature makes to escape this grapple are made against the same DC the creature made its initial check against, in place of your Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can use a bonus action on your turn to attempt to make a grapple in this way. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this ability as a bonus action again.</p>

            <description>When you attempt a grapple you can use your bandages to make the grapple check. This grapple does not occupy one of your hands but you can only have one creature grappled this way. Additionally you can attempt a grapple as a bonus action but can only do it once per short rest. When you grapple the DC is {{under wraps grapple:dc}}.</description>

            <p>A willing, living humanoid creature other than the spell’s caster is bound to the standing pole, which is raised into place, and the cursed nails driven through the creature’s palms. During the spell’s casting, the creature experiences intense agony similar to molten metal being poured through its veins, but takes no damage from this.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell’s caster must remain within range, chanting and making somatic gestures, for the spell’s entire casting time. If the spell’s caster has direct control over at least two zombies or similar undead (such as with the spell animate dead), they can be instructed to fulfill the spell’s verbal and somatic components, even if they ordinarily cannot speak.</p>
            <p class="indent">Upon the spell’s completion, the willing creature dies and is instantly resurrected as an awakened undead with the necropolitan subrace, using the race it formerly belonged to for the awakened undead’s Past Life racial trait. If the spell is interrupted before completion, the willing creature dies but is not resurrected, and the spell slot and any material components are consumed.</p>
