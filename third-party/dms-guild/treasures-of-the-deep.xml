		<description>
			<p><em>Forgotten shipwrecks. Underwater caverns. Hidden pirate coves. Haunted lighthouses. These are just a few locations where powerful magic items are waiting to be discovered by adventurers brave and bold enough to explore the savage seas and untamed oceans.</em></p>
			<p>Inspired by the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure Ghosts of Saltmarsh, this product supplements that content by providing additional rewards and ideas for players and Dungeon Masters. These are the types of items adventurers might find inside a shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean, locked away in a chest found in a pirate cove, wielded by a kua-toa shaman, hidden in an underwater cave, or guarded by a legendary sea creature. The items are meant to enhance the immersion of sea based adventures and inspire players to connect more with the nautical theme.</p>

Each hostile creature that can hear within a 60 foot radius must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it cannot willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also cannot take reactions.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Command of Inspiration.</em></strong> Loud words of motivation are emitted from the conch, encouraging your allies in battle. Each friendly creature that can hear within a 60 foot radius has advantage on its next attack roll.</p>

	<element name="The Captain’s Log" type="Magic Item" source="Treasures of the Deep" id="ID_DMSG_TOTD_MAGIC_ITEM_CAPTAINS_LOG">
		<description>
			<p>This leather-bound journal contains 100 pages recounting the stories and exploits of Captain James Murgan. Reading a story aloud may inspire those around you. Roll a 1d100 and refer to the table on the following page to select the title of a chapter within the book. One or more players may tell an original story inspired by the title. At the DM’s discretion, they may award inspiration to each player that told a tale worthy of legend. This book cannot be used again in this way until 3 days have passed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Captain’s Insight.</em></strong> The Captain’s Log has magically inherited much of the experience and knowledge that Captain Murgan gained during his years at sea. While attuned to the Log, you gain proficiency in the Intelligence (History) skill and with navigator’s tools.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ghost Ship.</em></strong> While attuned to the Captain’s Log, you can use an action to speak its command word to transform it into a ship. When the word is spoken, the book opens and a ghostly fog pours out in a 30-foot radius from the book. The fog’s area is heavily obscured. Once the fog has filled its entire 30-foot radius area, the ship appears. The ship is 40 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 8 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, six sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a rectangular sail. The ship can hold twenty Medium creatures comfortably. When the book becomes the ship, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size. An action can be used to speak its command word, causing the boat to transform back into the book, provided that no creatures are aboard. The ghostly fog surrounds the boat as it changes shape. Any objects in the vessel appear outside the book after it transforms.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse of the Drowned Sailor.</em></strong> The Captain’s Log has witnessed more than a few sailors fall overboard and drown, and those events have left an impression on the book. When you first become attuned to the artifact, you feel the sense of dread of the countless sailors who have drowned in the book’s vicinity and you take 4d10 psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to the artifact and you are more than 10 feet away from it, your ears and lungs are filled with the sensation of rushing water and you feel as if you are drowning. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 minute). When you run out of breath, you can survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of your next turn, you drop to 0 Hit Points and are dying, and you cannot regain Hit Points or be stabilized until you are within 10 feet of the Log and can breathe again. If you remain out of range of the book, you begin dying from this drowning effect and must roll death saving throws. On your third success, you become stable, end the drowning effect, and lose your attunement to the Log. On your third failure, you die, and your soul is consumed by the Log. You cannot be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. Destroying the Log will release your soul.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Log.</em></strong> Destroying the Captain’s Log requires it be left in direct sunlight for 100 consecutive days. At the end of the 100th day, the book shrivels into an unreadable mass and loses its powers. If the book is destroyed while a creature is attuned to it, that creature dies. Any souls that were trapped inside the Log are set free. Submerging the book in salt water for 1d20 + 1 years will repair its condition and restore its powers.</p>
