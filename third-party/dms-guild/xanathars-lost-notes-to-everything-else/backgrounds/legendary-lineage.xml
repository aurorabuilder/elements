		<description>
			<p>You have heroes in your family background and the story of your ancestors is known far and wide. Perhaps your parents were a famous adventuring duo, or a grandparent hunted and killed great evils. Maybe your heroic bloodline has many heroes within it going back as far as any can remember. Whatever the case, the deeds of those who came before you are great and the public’s expectation of your accomplishments is even greater. The weight of your family name affects all you do.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, History</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Vehicles (land)</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of traveler’s clothes, a wood figure made in the likeness of an ancestor, a signet ring, a gaming set in which you are proficient, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>You’ve lived a different life than those less famous than you, and probably don’t know yourself as well as you should. Since birth you’ve been told you are special and destined for greatness, which is an idea you may be eager to prove or disprove. You’re used to being under pressure and to folks talking about you both to your face and behind your back. As you start your adventuring career you have a choice to make. Most people of a heroic lineage who adventure either embrace the family name or try to get out there and make their own way. The result, however, is the same – a determined hero trying to show the world they’re something more just a lucky kid with the right parents.</p>

			<p>Since your family name is known, you can reap many benefits by flying the flag of your heritage. People in positions of power and privilege are willing to take a meeting with you and grant you favors. The DM decides the extent and effect of these favors, but they shouldn’t involve lavish gifts or great personal risk to the granter.</p>
