		<description>
			<p>You believe in a doctrine outlawed by your faith, taught to you in secret by other heretics. Perhaps your superiors excommunicated you from your temple, or forbidden dogma provided answers to questions you never sought. Whatever your origin, you’re now shunned by the faithful, or worse, hunted.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Religion</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A holy symbol (subtly modified to represent your own heretical belief), a prayer book or prayer wheel, vestments, a bottle of invisible ink, a quill, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Heretics survive by living on the run, or by blending into the ranks of greater faiths. They tend to be suspicious folk with zealous ideals and unshakable convictions. This sometimes manifests as a sense of superiority over the “unenlightened”.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You know where to find heretics in settlements where your faith is represented. If no heretics are present, you can indoctrinate weak-willed souls if you spend a day preaching. Where heretics are present, you can always find a place to hide, rest and recuperate. If needed, they can help you escape the settlement on a cart or through a secret tunnel.</p>
