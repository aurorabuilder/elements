			<p>You have lived a life of adventure already and retired to something quieter. You thought you were done and to that end may have given away all your old gear and spent all your treasure. Little did you know something would pull you back into your old life. If you choose this background you have some exciting questions to answer.</p>
			<p class="indent">You determine what your past looked like. What adventures have you already had? How much time did you spend adventuring before retirement? Who was your most-hated enemy? Who did you adventure with? Why did you hang it up?</p>
			<p class="indent">Something happened that made you lose your edge and finally honed adventuring skills. Has age or luxurious retirement made you soft? Did a physical or magical accident take some abilities from you? Did a supernatural force steal your mojo?</p>
			<p class="indent">You have decided to walk the road of adventure once again. Why? Was it because you ran out of gold and want to earn some more the only way you know how? Did you become restless in retirement and are now seeking the thrill of battle? Are you out to prove you can still live up to your legend? Are you out for vengeance? A noble quest? To tie up one final lose end you didn’t realize until now was undone? Whatever the reason, you’re back on the road and ready to dive into another dungeon.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> History, Insight</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of gaming set</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> An old map to a secret dungeon you never got around to visiting, a set of common clothes, a set of bone dice or a deck of cards, and a purse containing 25 gp</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>As a voice of experience in your party, you know the danger of the road you walk. You understand when to be cautious and when it is time to take a risk. You have the right advice, warnings, and stories for all situations. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, your past makes others look to you for leadership.</p>

			<p>Whenever you are in a civilized area that knows of you past adventures, you can live a aristocratic life style for free as people wish to honor your past deeds. You can also use your influence to gain audiences with important political figures and get random gifts from admiring fans. However if you choose to use your influence in this way, it also alerts anyone in the area looking for you of your location and draws attention to your party.</p>
