			<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn five master runes; Ild (fire), Kalt (frost), Ond (spirit), Stein (Stone), and Vind (wind). While these names are known to you as the basis for empowering your equipment, their application continues to require diligent study, constant trial, and repeated error to evoke the unique properties from each variant invocation.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you learn augmentations that utilize the master runes to enhance your martial prowess. Their effects are based on how you invoke them, generating defensive properties to thwart your foes’ advance or deal decisive blows.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Crafting.</em></strong> Each runic combination must be inscribed and empowered into your equipment over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest. Each piece of equipment must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which, you infuse a part of your being into the runes, causing them to glow slightly with your own spiritual essence.</p>
			<p class="indent">The rune’s power fades if it moves more than 100 feet away from you and can’t be used by anyone other than you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Runic Augmentations.</em></strong> You learn three runic augmentations of your choice, which are detailed under “Runic Augmentations” below. Each augmentation is specific to its master rune; for instance, if you learn the Sokn augmentation of the Ild master rune, you don’t gain the ability to use the Sokn augmentation with other master runes unless you also learn that specific combination.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you activate one of your runic augmentations, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
			<p class="indent">You learn two additional augmentations at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn new augmentations, you can choose to replace one you already know with a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Augmentation Activation.</em></strong> During your turn, you can activate a single runic augmentation by focusing on the rune’s power. You can activate one of these augmentations on your turn using your bonus action to empower your attacks (Sokn), your reaction to entrench your defenses (Vard) or skillfully enhance another ability (Hagr) with your action.</p>
			<p class="indent">Activating a rune requires concentration, which lasts a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 3). While you concentrate on a rune, you can cast spells but you can’t concentrate on a rune and a spell at the same time. You gain the ability to concentrate on two runes at once at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> Some of your runic augmentations require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Runic save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
			</center>
