			<p>Your innate magic comes from fey magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their ancestry back to a lord or lady of the Plane of Faerie. Other fey sorcerers are descendants of warlocks who of made a pact with an archfey. The rarest of these sorcerers are those who travel to the Feywild and manage to absorb some of the plane’s natural magic by happenstance.</p>

When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>
