			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric sell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Divine Herald Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and you have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Divine Herald Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of known spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
