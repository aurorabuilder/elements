			<p>Clerics and shamans of primitive tribes living in harsh environments have no greater mission than ensuring the survival of their tribes. The gods of survival often have other domains in similar realms, such as life or nature. The worshippers who work within the Survival domain, however, are much more primal and brutal than their counterparts.</p>
			<p class="indent">The gods of primitive and uncivilized races are most likely to hold this domain: lizardfolk god Semuanya and orc goddess Luthic are prime examples of deities whose clerics embrace the Survival domain. They are more likely to remain in their territories, nurturing and protecting their flocks, but fighting fiercely when a threat invades their lairs.</p>
