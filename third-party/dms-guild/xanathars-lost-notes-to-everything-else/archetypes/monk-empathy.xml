		<description>
			<p>Monks of the Way of Empathy follow the tradition instilled with compassion for all living beings. While their training includes martial practice as a form of selfdiscipline, their teachings also focus on a healing art of rare form, known as Empathy. Using these techniques, they learn to manipulate the ki to transfer malady and pain from another to themselves. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to the sick and the poor, while others find their calling side by side with soldiers, rehabilitating the fallen in battle. Their scars might telltale of thousands of warriors, without ever feeling the cold of steel against their own flesh.</p>
