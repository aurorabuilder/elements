			<p>Some worlds thrive, with large swathes of the land covered with flora and fauna that can be both beautiful and dangerous while other lands, or other worlds, become desolate wastelands through cataclysmic occurrences either natural or manufactured. Apocalyptic events turn the land into hazardous voids more dangerous than any monster. Only the hardiest life forms survive, and even they are often mutated into hideous reflections of their natural selves.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Sea of Silt in Dark Sun’s Athas, the Mournland of Eberron, and the spellplagued areas of Faerûn are just some examples in lore. Forged in harsh kiln of apocalyptic survival are the Wasteland Wanderer. These rangers of ruin rely on the skills and knowledge they have gathered by surviving the terrible conditions of their world— and often helping others survive as well.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you become harder to ambush and can’t be surprised while within your favored terrain. If a member of your party is surprised at the start of combat, you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can use your bonus action to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to notice hidden enemies. If you notice a hidden creature, you can immediately move up to half your speed and make one additional weapon attack against that target, as part of that same bonus action. When you do, you have advantage on the attack and you deal an additional 2d8 damage on a hit.</p>

			<p>Starting at 7th level, you have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores. You gain this benefit even while traveling at a normal pace, instead of a slow pace, while you are in your favored terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can use your Primeval Awareness feature to focus your senses to unnatural disturbances nearby. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can divine the types of traps to a range of 60 feet, learning how they trigger, and the type of damage they deal. When you do so, you also gain resistance to traps you identify with this feature until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
