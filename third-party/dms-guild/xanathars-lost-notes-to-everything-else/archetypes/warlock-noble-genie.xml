			<p>Your pact is one that has been made by legendary advisors, philosophers, and tale-spinners of the desert lands, known throughout the land of Zakhara as sha’irs. Your patron is a noble genie, a creature whose spirit is infused with the primordial essence of the Elemental Planes. These creatures are the rarest and most powerful of their kind. They aim to achieve ultimate greatness, splendor, and the reverence of all beings.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though noble genies aren’t gods, they feel deserving of such veneration from their servants. They’re accustomed to wealth and opulence and treat their insatiable indulgence as an entitlement to their own power and grandeur.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, your patron assigns a lesser genie, a gen, to accompany you during your travels. The type of gen is dependent upon your patron’s genie type as defined on the Noble Genie Patron table. Your gen vizier isn’t required to obey your commands, although it usually tries to the best of its ability, and doesn’t participate in combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefit from your gen vizier.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Fetching.</em></strong> You can send your gen to find and retrieve the knowledge of an additional spell you don’t know. The spell must be of a level you can cast and can be from any class spell list. As a bonus action, you can request a spell for your gen to retrieve and it returns in a number of rounds equal to 1d12 minus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
			<p class="indent">When the gen returns, it immediately imparts the spell knowledge to you at the beginning of your turn, which you can then cast normally by expending a spell slot. If you don’t cast the spell within two rounds of receiving it, the spell knowledge disappears, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature twice between long rests at 6th level and three times between long rests at 14th level.</p>
