			<p>Burghal Explorers are at home in tight places, making their living as urban bounty hunters or guiding magical search crews through dangerous ruins. Dark slums and ruined cities, choked with thirsty weeds and decorated with crumbling remnants of once-thriving communities, become gathering points for desperate innocents—and for sneak-thieves and bandits who prey on the helpless.</p>
			<p class="indent">Burghal Explorers toe the line between the natural forest and cityscapes, moonlighting as vigilantes, or fending off unnatural horrors that reach covetously toward the darkest, deepest, plots of land.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to hinder your foes with your strikes. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can graze your target’s arm, leg, chest, or head. When you do, the creature takes an additional 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type and you impose one of the follow effects on that target:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Head.</em></strong> It has disadvantage the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Arm.</em></strong> It has disadvantage on the next Strength check or attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Leg.</em></strong> Its movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chest.</em></strong> It must succeed a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 5 feet away from you. If it hits a wall, or other permanent structure as a result of being pushed, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>

			<p>You are particularly familiar with one type of urban environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>

				<li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
				<li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
				<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
				<li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
				<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
				<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
