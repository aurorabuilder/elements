		<description>
			<p>Those who think charm and misdirection are the trades of the bard and warlock never heard of the arcane colleges specializing in Beguiling magic. The tradition blends enchantment and illusion magic, rather than specializing in either of those schools.</p>
			<p class="indent">Followers of this tradition are known as beguilers and believe a brilliant mind beats a charming personality. They see magic as a way to persuade, deceive, entertain, and hide and believe fooling the mind is magic’s most potent use. Beguilers are suave and adept spies, equipped to infiltrate any organization or compound without detection or with minimal casualties.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, you know how to strike subtly with a spell and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) to one creature you hit with a spell attack from a wizard cantrip if you have advantage on the attack roll.</p>
			<p class="indent">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll or your target has made a saving throw against one of your enchantment or illusion spells since the beginning of your last turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The amount of the extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to double your Intelligence modifier at 11th level, and triple your Intelligence modifier at 17th level.</p>
