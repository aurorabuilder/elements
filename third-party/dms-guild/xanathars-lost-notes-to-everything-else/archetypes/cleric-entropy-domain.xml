			<p>Heretics preach of a void at the center of the universe that dying gods created to devour the Weave. The necrotic energy it emits is called “Entropy”: a potent force that clerics can harness to shield themselves from magic and annihilate arcane casters. The chained god Tharizdun claims this domain, while in Chessenta, a giant sphere of annihilation is worshipped as an aspect of Entropy itself. Cultists who wield the power go by many names: thaumatoclasts, entropomancers, or entropists.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to disrupt the flow of magic in your vicinity.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you conjure an aura of disruptive energy that radiates from you in a 15-foot radius. The aura lasts until the end of your next turn, and moves with you, centered on you. While inside the aura, any creature that attempts to cast a spell must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw. If they fail the save, their spell fails to cast and the spell slot is wasted.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to drain a caster’s magical power. When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or successfully disrupt a spell using Arcane Disruption, you can force the caster to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the caster loses an additional spell slot of the same level. If they possess no more slots of that level, they instead gain a level of exhaustion.</p>
