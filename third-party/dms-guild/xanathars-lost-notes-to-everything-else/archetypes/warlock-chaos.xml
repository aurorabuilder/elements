			<p>You have made a pact with a creature that revels in the madness and infinite possibility of the chaotic planes. Your patron could be a powerful slaad lord of Limbo, an ever-changing and roiling soup of impermanent matter and energy. Your patron could be a god of madness, such as Cyric, or a demon lord-in-exile in the depths of Pandemonium, a dark plane of tunnels carved by howling winds. Your patron could be a fearsome giant or celestial valkyrie of Ysgard, a heroic plane of soaring mountains, endless battles, and boundless creativity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unlike devils with their carefully crafted words and contracts, your patron is beholden to nothing but its twisted whims. Many chaos warlocks find their powers to be a cruel curse, but those who embrace the chaos learn that unpredictability is their greatest source of strength.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, you can conjure a portal to travel through the planes of chaos. You can cast dimension door with this feature without expending a spell slot or material components. However, denizens of that plane try to hamper your progress. When you use your action to use this feature in this way, you declare your intended destination and then roll 1d4 to determine how the denizens intervene. Whenever you would bring a willing creature with you, that creature always arrives at the intended destination unharmed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. At 14th level, at the end of the turn you use this feature, you can roll 1d6 and, on a 6, you regain the use of this feature immediately.</p>

			<p>Your dreams are so nonsensical they would drive most creatures insane, but your senses have been dulled to the madness. Starting at 10th level, you gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness checks, and your physical form begins to reflect the chaos in your mind.
