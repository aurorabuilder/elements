	<!-- Intuition Die Trait -->
	<element name="Intuition Die" type="Racial Trait" source="Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron" id="ID_WOTC_WGTE_RACIAL_TRAIT_INTUITION_DIE">
		<description>
			<p>Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don't have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one.</p>
