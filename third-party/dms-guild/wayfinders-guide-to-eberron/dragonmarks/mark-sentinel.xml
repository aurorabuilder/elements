		<description>
			<p>The Mark of Sentinel warns and protects. It heightens senses and reflexes, allowing an heir to respond to threats with uncanny speed. It can shield its bearer from harm. Whether on the battlefield or the ballroom, someone who carries the Mark of Sentinel is prepared for danger. </p>
			<h4>HOUSE DENEITH</h4>
			<p>House Deneith was born in Karrnath, and war flows in its veins. For centuries, the Blademarks Guild of House Deneith has governed the mercenary trade. While warriors with the Mark of Sentinel are among its most elite forces, House Deneith brokers the services of a wide range of soldiers, including Valenar warbands and the goblins of Droaam. Beyond the battlefield, the Defender’s Guild provides exceptional bodyguards for those who can afford their services. House Deneith is also renowned for its Sentinel Marshals, agents that hold the authority to pursue criminals and enforce the law across the length of Khorvaire. The Sentinel Marshals hold the honor of the house in their hands. Being a Marshal is a privilege, and it comes with high expectations. </p>
			<p class="indent">The dragonmarked houses aren’t allowed to own land or hold noble titles. House Deneith has always abided by these edicts, maintaining absolute neutrality and selling its services to all sides of a conflict. However, there’s a faction that feels that Deneith should use its power for its own purposes, not just in the service of others. House Deneith is also caught in an escalating rivalry with House Tharashk, which is edging into the mercenary trade.  </p>
			<h4>MARK OF SENTINEL TRAITS</h4>
			<p>The Mark of Sentinel only manifests on humans. These traits replace the human Ability Score Increase trait given in the Player’s Handbook. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Strength and Wisdom scores both increase by 1. In addition, one ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentinel’s Intuition. </i></b>When you roll for Initiative or make a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a threat, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add it to the ability check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentinel’s Shield. </i></b>You know the cantrip <i>blade ward</i>. You can cast <i>shield</i> once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Vigilant Guardian. </i></b>As an action, you can designate an ally you can see as your ward. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot threats to your ward. In addition, when you are within 5 feet of your ward, and that creature is the target of an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to swap places with your ward. When you do, you become the target of the attack.</p>
