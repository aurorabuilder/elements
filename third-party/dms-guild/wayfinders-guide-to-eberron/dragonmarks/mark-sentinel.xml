			<p>The Mark of Sentinel warns and protects. It heightens senses and reflexes, allowing an heir to respond to threats with uncanny speed. It can shield its bearer from harm. Whether on the battlefield or the ballroom, someone who carries the Mark of Sentinel is prepared for danger.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Strength and Wisdom scores both increase by 1. In addition, one ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentinel’s Intuition. </i></b>When you roll for Initiative or make a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a threat, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add it to the ability check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sentinel’s Shield. </i></b>You know the cantrip <i>blade ward</i>. You can cast <i>shield</i> once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Vigilant Guardian. </i></b>As an action, you can designate an ally you can see as your ward. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot threats to your ward. In addition, when you are within 5 feet of your ward, and that creature is the target of an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to swap places with your ward. When you do, you become the target of the attack.</p>
