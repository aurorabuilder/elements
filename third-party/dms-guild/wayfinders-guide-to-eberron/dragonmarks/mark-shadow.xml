			<p>The Mark of Shadows lets an elf weave illusions from shadows, crafting sounds and images to distract or delight. The mark also allows its bearer to draw on the shadows, making it an easy matter to avoid detection or even disappear while in plain sight. It is a valuable tool for an entertainer, a spy, or an assassin.</p>
			<h4>THE HOUSE OF SHADOW</h4>
			<p>The elves have carried the Mark of Shadow for thousands of years. The families that carry the mark left Aerenal after the conflict that wiped  out the Mark of Death and established House Phiarlan in Khorvaire. These elves are the finest entertainers in the land, giving them access to all manner of places and secrets. But the elves do more than entertain. There has always been an elite force of spies and assassins within the house. Common folk know nothing of this. Only special clients—powerful nobles, merchant lords, and the like—have access to these shadow-marked spies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Toward the end of the Last War, a bitter feud broke out between the major families of the house. Known as the Shadow Schism, it resulted in a split withinin Phiarlan—and the foundation of House Thuranni. House Phiarlan continues to offer entertainment and espionage in the lands west of the Mournland, while Thuranni operates in Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, and the eastern lands. As a rule, Phiarlan elves are the better spies and Thuranni agents are superior assassins. On the surface Thuranni and Phiarlan maintain a peaceful relationship, but rivalries run deep.</p>
