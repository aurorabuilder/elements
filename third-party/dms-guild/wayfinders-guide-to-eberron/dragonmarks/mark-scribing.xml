		<description>
			<p>The Mark of Scribing deals with communication—both the written and spoken word. A gnome who bears the mark can feel words as though they are living creatures, struggling to make their meaning known. The mark provides a range of gifts. It translates languages, but it also allows its bearer to communicate with others at a distance.</p>
			<h4>HOUSE SIVIS</h4>
			<p>The gnomes of House Sivis facilitate communication. This is seen most literally in speaking stones, magic items allowing a Sivis heir to send a short message to another speaking stone; House Sivis’s network of message stations is the backbone of long-distance communication. But Sivis also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders and more. House Sivis has an especially close relationship with House Kundarak, as Kundarak letters of credit must be notarized with a Sivis arcane mark.</p>
			<p class="indent">House Sivis has taken great pains to maintain the trust of its clients and takes a position of absolute neutrality in all disputes, whether between houses or nations. Gnomes have a natural love of intrigue, and the different families within the house often engage in subtle schemes and feuds, but these are never allowed to threaten the house as a whole. Sivis gnomes are typically friendly, curious, and engaging; but that kindly exterior may conceal a scheming mind. </p>
			<h4>INTUITION DICE</h4>
			<p>Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don’t have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one.</p>
			<h4>MARK OF SCRIBING TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Characters with the Mark of Scribing gain the following traits</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Charisma score increases by 1.<br />
