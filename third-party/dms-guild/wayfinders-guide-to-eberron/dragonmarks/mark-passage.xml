			<p>The Mark of Passage governs motion, allowing its bearer to move with uncanny speed and precision. Running, leaping, climbing—the Mark of Passage enhances every form of movement. The bearer of the mark can even slip through space, leaping from point to point in the blink of an eye. </p>
			<h4>HOUSE ORIEN</h4>
			<p>The House of Passage manages land transportation. The lightning rail is the house’s most dramatic tool, but Orien runs caravans and coaches across the length of Khorvaire. Dragonshard focus items ensure that the fastest vehicles are those driven by heirs with the Mark of Passage, but the house also licenses unmarked teamsters. The Courier’s Guild of House Orien delivers mail and packages and has a branch that handles more covert and dangerous deliveries.  </p>
			<p class="indent">Orien has dominated transportation for centuries, but now the house is facing challenges. The Mournland is a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation, and the expanding role of Lyrandar airships threatens Orien’s business. Long distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien heirs can provide. Now Orien, seeking to expand its use of teleportation, is working with Cannith to find ways to unlock and enhance this ultimate gift of the Mark of Making. Orien heirs may be caught up in these experiments or in the rivalry with House Lyrandar, or they may stay close to the ground and just keep moving. </p>
			<h4>INTUITION DICE</h4>
			<p>Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don't have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one.</p>
			<h4>MARK OF PASSAGE TRAITS</h4>
			<p>The Mark of Passage only manifests on humans. These traits replace the human Ability Score Increase trait given in the Player’s Handbook. </p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. <br />
				<span class="feature">Courier's Speed. </span>Your base walking speed increases to 40 ft. <br />
				<span class="feature">Intuitive Motion. </span>When you make a Strength (Athletics) check or any ability check to operate or maintain a land vehicle, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.<br />
				<span class="feature">Determined Stride. </span>When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement on that turn.<br />
				<span class="feature">Shared Passage. </span>As a bonus action you can teleport a distance up to your walking speed, ending in an unoccupied space that you can see. You can bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you use this trait. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. <br />
