			<p class="flavor">I am klashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. Her memories come to me in dreams, and at times her voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight il—Lashtavar.</p>
			<p style="text-align:right">— Lakashtai, servant of the light</p>
			<p>The kalashtar are a compound race created from the union of humanity with renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called the quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. But there is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, and they are haunted by the conflicts of the otherworldly spirits.</p>
			<h4>BOUND TO SPIRITS</h4>
			<p>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, shared by other members of their bloodline. Physically, kalashtar appear human, but the spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features. Their movements and body language are different from those of humans; most beings find it graceful, but to some it feels unnerving. The eyes of a kalashtar often glow when it is focused on a task or feeling strong emotions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. A kalashtar might experience the relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants the kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these dream—spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors, while others are more contemplative or kind; a kalashtar player and DM can work together to determine the nature of the linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some—for instance, an orphan kalashtar raised among outsiders—might know nothing of their spirits or the source of their psychic gifts.</p>
			<p class="indent">The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks of behavior. A kalashtar player can roll or select a trait from the following table</p>
			<h6>KALASHTAR QUIRKS</h6>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>1d10</td><td>Quirk</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You apply dream logic to mundane situations.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9</td><td>You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10</td><td>You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h4>HUNTED BY NIGHTMARES</h4>
			<p>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar feld from the dream realm of Dal Quor to escape the evil spirits that dominate the realm. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can eventually change the fundamental nature of the Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Thus, most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion to the faith known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans on Eberron. Through the force known as Dreaming Dark, these monsters are manipulating the people of Khorvaire and eliminating kalashtar whenever possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by living in close-knit communities, focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. But some among the kalashtar feel obliged to seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or simply to protect the innocent however they can. There are some kalashtar who have grown up isolated from their kind, who know nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans may use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can often cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings</p>
			<h4>KALASHTAR NAMES</h4>
			<p>A kalashtar name is formed by the blend of a personal prefix tied to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Each spirit has a gender identity, but this may or may not match the gender identity of the kalashtar host. Thus, a female kalashtar might have what others would consider a masculine name, because she's tied to a spirit with a masculine identity. Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the names of their spirits and instead take names from the cultures they're raised in.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Male Quori Names: </b>Hareth, Khad, Kosh, Melk, Tash, Ulad, Vash<br />
				<b>Female Quori Names: </b>Ashana, Ashtai, Ishara, Nari, Tana, Tari, Vakri<br />
				<b>Kalashtar Names: </b>Coratash, Dalavash, Dolishara, Halakosh, Khoratari, Koratana, Lanhareth, Molavakri, Nevitash, Sorashana, Torashtai, Valakhad, Vishara
