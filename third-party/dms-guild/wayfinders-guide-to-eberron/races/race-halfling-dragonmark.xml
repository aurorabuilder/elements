    <description>
      <p>A halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer sense the nature of maladies and afflictions and find the best solution. When equipped with dragonshard focus items, the mark can even draw the dead back from the depths of Dolurrh. </p>
      <h4>HOUSE JORASCO</h4>
      <p>The Healer’s Guild provides a vital service to Khorvaire, and the Last War ensured that there was great need for healers. The guild runs the schools that teach medicine and houses of healing that provide both mundane and magical services. If it could save a life, it’s probably tied Jorasco... and it will come with a cost. If you have the gold, Jorasco healers can remove a disease instantly with lesser restoration. If you can't afford such service, they will treat you with mundane techniques (the Medicine skill). House Jorasco is also the source of potions of Healing. While many criticize Jorasco’s demands for payment, the leaders of the house maintain that it’s not about greed; it’s about ensuring the survival and prosperity of the house, so they can continue to help future generations.</p>
      <p class="indent">While the public face of Jorasco is that of the healer, there are rumors that the house engaged in disturbing experiments during the Last War, working with House Vadalis to develop biological weapons and strange new creatures. A Jorasco heir will have to decide if they want to investigate these rumors... and what they'll do if the rumors are true. </p>
      <h4>INTUITION DICE</h4>
      <p>Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don't have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.</p>
      <p class="indent">Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one.</p>
      <h4>MARK OF HEALING TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Characters with the Mark of Healing gain the following traits</p>
      <p>
        <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br />
        <span class="feature">Medical Intuition. </span>When you make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.  <br />
        <span class="feature">Healing Touch. </span>As an action, you can draw power from your dragonmark to spend one of your Hit Dice and revitalize yourself or a creature you touch. Roll the die, add your Wisdom modifier, and the creature regains a number of hit points equal to the total. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. <br />

      <p>They may not always have gold, but a halfling with the Mark of Hospitality is sure to be rich in friends. The magic of the mark allows the bearer to keep a place clean, and to heat, chill, and season food. But it also helps the bearer connect with others, setting troubled minds at ease—a powerful tool, though it can cause anger if abused. </p>
      <h4>HOUSE GHALLANDA</h4>
      <p>The majority of inns, taverns, and restaurants in the Five Nations are either directly owned by House Ghallanda or licensed by its Hosteler’s Guild. Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda’s strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears many things—if you want to know what’s really going on in the community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House Ghallanda don’t sell information; they prefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron every truly need something, they likely have a favor they can call in. </p>
      <p class="indent">Ghallanda has a number of “bound businesses”—franchises run directly by the house. The Gold Dragon Inn is such a business, and Gold Dragon Inns can be found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns that are licensed by Ghallanda. The blink dog seal is an assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of health and quality- but not every inn is run by a halfling. </p>
