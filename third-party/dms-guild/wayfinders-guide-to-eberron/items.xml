			<p>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you’re an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you’re not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you’re worthy to wield it.</p>

			<p>When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-bladed scimitar, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the blade at the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon’s damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals slashing damage.</p>
