		<description>
			<p>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you’re an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you’re not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you’re worthy to wield it.</p>

			<p>When you take the attack action and make a two-handed attack with a double-bladed scimitar, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the blade at the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon’s damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals slashing damage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dragonshards are crystals imbued with raw mystical energy. They are the fuel that drives the magical economy, playing a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of arcane rituals.</p>
			<p>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil, and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron shards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q’barra and the distant land of Xen’drik. In their raw form, Eberron shards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing their depths</p>
			<p class="indent">Eberron shards are the most common form of dragonshard. They are primarily refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Dragonshard dust is used in the creation of magic items, and many powerful tools—such as the lightning rail and elemental airships—require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dragonshards are crystals imbued with raw mystical energy. They are the fuel that drives the magical economy, playing a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of arcane rituals.</p>
			<p>Khyber dragonshards are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These living crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins.</p>
			<p class="indent">Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber shard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, any other effects that trap or manipulate spirits Khyber dragonshards are also used for many necromantic rituals.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dragonshards are crystals imbued with raw mystical energy. They are the fuel that drives the magical economy, playing a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of arcane rituals.</p>
			<p>Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant shard fields in the continent of Xen’drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golding veins gleaming within.</p>
			<p class="indent">Siberys dragonshards have a close affinity to dragonmarks and are a vital part of any dragonmark focus item. Larger shards may be required for eldritch machines or used in the creation of legendary items or artifacts.</p>

This bright light is mounted inside a normal bullseye lantern, allowing the light to be shuttered off. An everbright lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone, just like a mundane bullseye lantern, but its flame never goes out.</p>

			<p>Glamerweave clothing is imbued with cosmetic illusions. Traditionally, these patterns are contained within the cloth, but higher-end glamerweave can have more dramatic effects. You could have a gown that appears to be wreathed in flames, or a hat that's orbited by illusory butterflies. Regardless of the design, these are cosmetic effects and have no impact on combat.</p>

			<p>A spellshard is a polished Eberron dragonshard, sized to fit into the palm of a hand. The shard is imbued with a particular work of literature. By holding the shard and concentrating, you can see its pages in your mind’s eye. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic will draw you to the first section that addresses it,  and a simple ritual allows you to add content to the shard.</p>
			<p class="indent">An arcane caster can use a spellshard instead of a spellbook; the spellshard costs 1 gp per “page” in the shard, and otherwise functions as a mundane spellbook. Spellshards can also be used as diaries or journals. More advanced (and uncommon) shards can require a particular mental passphrase to access the contents of the shard.</p>

			<p>An <em>armblade</em> is a weapon designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged. If you’re a warforged, you can attach an <em>armblade</em> by attuning to it. An attached <em>armblade</em> cannot be disarmed or removed from you against your will, but while the weapon is attached you cannot use that hand for other actions. You can spend one minute to end the attunement and remove the <em>armblade</em>.</p>

	<element name="Docent" type="Magic Item" source="Wayfinder’s Guide to Eberron" id="ID_WOTC_WGTE_MAGIC_ITEM_DOCENT">
		<description>
			<p>A <em>docent</em> is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. If you’re a warforged, you can attune to the <em>docent</em>, at which point the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life—literally.</p>
			<p class="indent">A docent is an intelligent magic item designed to advise and assist the warforged it’s attached to. A typical docent has an Intelligence score of 16 and Wisdom and Charisma scores of 14. Once you’re attuned to the docent, it can communicate with you telepathically and can perceive the world through your senses. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elven and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen’drik may have never encountered a dwarf before... but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarven language.</p> 
			<p class="indent">In addition, a docent possesses up to three of the following traits.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can cast <em>Detect Magic</em> at will</li>
				<li>Can cast <em>Detect evil and good</em> at will</li>
				<li>Can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting the warforged host.</li>
				<li>Intelligence (Arcana) +7</li>
				<li>Intelligence (History) +7</li>
				<li>Intelligence (Investigation) +7</li>
				<li>Intelligence (Nature) +7</li>
				<li>Wisdom (Insight) +6</li>
				<li>Wisdom (Perception) +6</li>
				<li>The docent can make Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host, with a +7 bonus. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its traits on your behalf. In the case of skills, this uses the docent’s bonus; your abilities and proficiencies have no effect on the outcome. These traits are under the control of the docent, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you... or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.</p>
			<p class="indent">The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen’drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators... but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen’drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it’s possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.</p>

		<description>
			<p>An <em>wand sheath</em> is designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged. If you’re a warforged, you can attach an <em>wand sheath</em> by attuning to it. While the <em>wand sheath</em> is attached, it cannot be removed from you against your will. You can spend one minute to end the attunement and remove the <em>wand sheath</em>.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. While the wand is sheathed, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can retract the wand into your forearm or extend it from your forearm as a bonus action. While it is retracted, it cannot be damaged or removed.</li>
				<li>While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free for other actions.</li>
				<li>If the sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the <em>wand sheath</em> and the attached wand only count as a single item for purposes of the maximum number of items you can be attuned to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, you immediately lose your attunement to the wand.</li>
