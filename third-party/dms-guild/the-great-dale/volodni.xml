		<description>
			<p>Voldoni are the legacy of Nar refugees fleeing demons unleashed during the ancient wars between Narfell and Raumathar. They sought shelter beneath the bows of an ancient forest. Therein a great sylvan power denied them refuge unless they agreed to disavow their fiendish pacts and become one with the woods. Fearful of the destruction from which they fled, they readily agreed and were reborn as the pine folk, the volodni.</p>
			<h4>WOODY AND TOUGH</h4>
			<p>Tall and wiry, the volodni appear human-like but with tough woody flesh colored the browns and greens of pine trees. They grow long, bark-like hair and view the world through shimmering black eyes. They tend to use wooden weapons and wear leather armor dyed in the colors of their forest home.</p>
			<h4>CALM AND REMORSELESS</h4>
			<p>Most pine folk seem emotionless and cold, though a few can share the deep feelings of their distant human forebears. They have little use for laws imposed by rulers, preferring to live as their conscience directs them. They have long memories and are willing to wait patiently to enact vengeance on those who have wronged them.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Sylvan Sentinels</h5>
				<p>Many treefolk tend to be cold and dispassionate, remorseless and relentless in pursuit of any means which serves their ends. They remember every injury and have the patience of the bones of the earth when seeking revenge.</p>
				<p>Most tend to be disinterested in material possessions, as they have little need for them.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>FOREST PROTECTORS</h4>
			<p>The woods bordering the Great Dale are the volodni’s home. They ferociously protect their forest from any who dare cut fresh wood or despoil their natural homes. They seek to regrow the ancient forests to their past expansiveness. The volodni have no love of civilization’s growth or anything else that threatens the forests they call home.</p>
			<h4>VOLODNI NAMES</h4>
			<p>The pine folk frequently use a human name combined with a cherished forested location such as Dasha of Pineridge, Malark of the Silverbrook, or Navarra of Mauberg’s Oak</p>
			<p><strong>First Names:</strong>  (Male) Avan, Evendur, Gorstag, Petro, Randall, Stor, Urth; (Female) Anva, Esvele, Miri, Olma, Tana, Zlatara; (Gender Neutral) Baum, Jalon, Naury, Preed, Vancer</p>
			<p><strong>Favored Locations:</strong> Bright Creek, Dancing Falls, Deep Limb, Goldmarsh, Sharpridge, Whiteoaks</p>
			<h4>VOLODNI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your volodni character has a number of traits that are common to all of their race.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Treefolk are hardy and resilient, as well as intuitive. Your Wisdom and Constitution scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Volodni reach adulthood in their mid-twenties and a few individuals live beyond 150 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Volodni firmly believe in an individual’s call to act as they see fit, so they lean toward chaos. Though they are seldom actively malicious, neither are they always benevolent, though volodni are good more often than not.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Volodni are usually taller and leaner than most humans, averaging nearly 6 ½ feet in height, but weigh roughly the same as a typical human. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to the gloom of the deep forest, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Plant Traits.</em></strong> You have resistance to poison and piercing damage, as well as advantage on saving throws against sleep and charm effects.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you have disadvantage on saving throws to resist damage from magical fire, and you count as a plant creature for <em>blight</em> spells and similar effects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cold Iron Anathema.</em></strong> Due to your fey ancestry, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with metal weapons, and you can’t regain hit points while you wear metal armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Deep Slumber.</em></strong> Volodni can rest soundly in nearly any environment. If you sleep for 4 hours, you receive the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. However, because you sleep so deeply, your initiative rolls are at a disadvantage in the first minute after you awake.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Forest Hunter.</em></strong> If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily through forest terrain at a normal pace. In addition, you can attempt to hide in forest terrain even when only lightly obscured by foliage, falling rain or snow, or mist.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nature’s Avenger.</em></strong> You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.</p>
