		<description>
			<p>The Forest of Lethyr and Dunwood both support small populations of blueleaf trees scattered within. The volodni have mastered the ability to craft bluewood weapons and armor from these trees through the careful application of natural and arcane magic. The items crafted from bluewood are effectively as strong as their metal equivalents, but at half the weight. The volodni are exceptionally protective of the secrets to crafting these bluewood items and are greatly suspicious of any outsiders possessing them. In most commercial markets, bluewood items sell at double the cost of a similar weapon or piece of armor.</p>

	<element name="Crown of Whispers" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_CROWN_OF_WHISPERS">
		<description>
			<p>In the Year of the Fearless Peasant (926 DR), a pair of coronation crowns were fashioned for Princess Aliia of Impiltur and her betrothed, Rhiigard of Cormyr. However, the ship carrying the princess and her crowns were lost to the depths of the Inner Sea due to the scheming of Soneillon, a succubus known as the Queen of Whispers. The succubus later recovered these crowns and used them to cement her rule within the Giantspire Mountains by periodically lending them to the hobgoblin tribes who pledged their fealty to her.</p>
			<p class="indent">Soneillon is now gone, banished to the Abyss, but it is believed these two crowns are still are worn by the hobgoblin leaders who once served the demon.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing one of these crowns, your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on any opposed Charisma checks made with creatures who are not hostile towards you.</p>

	<element name="Crowsinger’s Locket" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_CROWSINGERS_LOCKET">
		<description>
			<p>This black locket in the shape of a crow’s skull has been in the possession of the Crow Witch for as long as anyone can remember. It is made out of pure obsidian, and when it is shaken something can be heard rattling inside.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing the locket, you can use an action to target one flying beast with a challenge rating of 0 and enter into its mind. The beast must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or you partially seize its mind. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, they are immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">While its mind is seized and it is within 8 miles of you, you can see through the creature’s eyes and hear what it hears, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. You can also control its movement. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. This effect lasts for 8 hours, and you can end it early at any point using a bonus action.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Nar Demonbinders of the ancient Empire of Narfell are said to have fashioned these small rusty bands of jagged iron. They are believed to have been used to fight alongside the demons they summoned, and to take more durable forms in order to mate with these fiends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While wearing this ring, you may use an action to speak its command word to cast polymorph on yourself with the following adjustments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You may only polymorph yourself into the form of a fiend of challenge rating 1 or lower.</li>
				<li>If you are polymorphed into the form of a fiend and you are the target of an effect that would otherwise banish you to another plane, you instead have the polymorph effect dispelled and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>

	<element name="Giligaxis’ Arcanist Treatise" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_GILIGAXIS_ARCANIST_TREATISE">
		<description>
			<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The front and back boards of this bound volume are fashioned of volodni bluewood and carved with delicate filigree depicting the stylized image of a rearing stag. The volume possesses no spine covering, allowing the fine copper thread that supports its parchment pages to be clearly visible.</p>
			<p><strong>History and Description:</strong> Giligaxis was a half-elven apprentice to the mage Nytholops, who in turn had studied beneath the Aubayreer, High Mage and founder of the sorcerous dynasty of Aglarond. It is believed that Giligaxis eventually settled in Impiltur but met an untimely end after striking his head on the floor of an inn during a raucous bar brawl. Nothing is known of what happened to the volume after that night until it was purchased by the gnomish wizard Brudgepiddle Raddishfoot while on a visit to Telflamme. Brudgepiddle is believed to now reside in Solin, where he runs a small tinker’s establishment.</p>
			<p><strong>Contents:</strong> There are thirty-two pages in this volume, with the foremost and final faces left as blank surfaces available and primed for protective magics such as a glyph of warding. The volume contains a selection of fourteen wizard spells of 1st to 3rd level. Of special note is the spell hail blast (see Chapter 5), a variant of sleet storm believed to have been conceived by Aubayreer.</p>
			<p>The final three pages are written in a different hand. They describe ley lines and fey nexus points found within the lands once bounded by the ancient Empire of Narfell.</p>

	<element name="Greatsword of Impiltur" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_GREATSWORD_OF_IMPILTUR">
		<description>
			<p>This mighty sword was given to the king of Impiltur in the Year of the Splendid Stag (734 DR) by the dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains. Many years later it was stolen from the royal vaults and recovered a century later when it was returned back to the crown. The sword was later lost at sea, only to be recovered by the scheming succubus, Soneillon. The succubus gave it to her death knight consort, who then carried it for centuries. Currently the weapon is believed to be in the hands of a powerful hobgoblin warlord somewhere in the Giantspire Mountains.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, you may immediately make another attack with the weapon against the same target.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Daze.</em></strong> On a successful attack against a creature, you may use a bonus action to force that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is stunned for up to 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until you finish a short or a long rest.</p>

	<element name="Hadryllis" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_HADRYLLIS">
		<description>
			<p>This legendary weapon was crafted by the first Vremyonni of ancient Raumathar. The Wychlaren speak of a tale in which the blade was pulled from a mountain near the mines of Tethkel, fully fashioned by the gods.</p>
			<p class="indent">The blade is believed to have been wielded by the half-Rus, half-Rashemi hero Yvgeni in his battles against the Demon Lord Eltab in the Year of Leather Shields (-75 DR).</p>
			<p class="indent">The sword eventually found its way to Mulhorand, where it again played a part in thwarting Eltab in the Year of Avarice (204 DR). The sword was last used by a group of heroes in the Year of the Shield (1367 DR) to prevent Szass Tam from binding Eltab beneath Thay to further the lich’s nefarious plans. The demon lord was believed to have been banished in this battle. It is unknown what happened to Hadryllis after the battle.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make a successful attack against a fiend, they take an extra 2d10 radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you hold the drawn sword, you may use an action to cast detect magic. Additionally, you may cast blindness, enhance ability (bull’s strength), and faerie fire, each up to three times per day, and are cast with a spell DC of 17.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> This weapon is sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand any language you know.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Hadryllis’ purpose is to destroy fiends. It will reluctantly attack other creatures if forced to, but believes the act to be unworthy of its attention. It will urge its wielder to aggressively pursue any fiend within sight, even attempting to control its wielder should they refuse to do so. (See Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 216, for a description of Sentient Magic Item Conflict).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Legendary Purpose.</em></strong> Hadryllis is believed to be the only item that can destroy the Adamantine Binding that was crafted by the Narfelli Demonbinders when they summoned Eltab into the Realms. The binding is found within the lower dungeons of the Citadel of Conjurers in Impiltur.</p>

	<element name="Jhuild" type="Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_ITEM_GEAR_JHUILD">
		<description>
			<p>Jhuild is an extremely potent Rashemi red wine often referred to as firewine. It is carried by most Rashemi berserkers due to its invigorating effects. Because of the wine’s potency (and expensiveness), it is usually sold outside of Rashemen in a diluted form mixed with common ale.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jhuild is not magical in nature, but as with other alcoholic beverages, it will identify as poison if examined using a detect poison and disease spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you may drink a flask of undiluted jhuild. You must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12) to avoid its effects, though you may voluntarily fail this saving throw. One minute after failing this saving throw, you experience the following effects, which last for 1 hour:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 20, while your Wisdom score decreases by 2.</li>
				<li>All Wisdom ability checks and saving throws are made at disadvantage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">At the end of this hour, your Strength returns to normal, but you must immediately succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 2d4 hours. Regardless of the result of your saving throw, your Wisdom score remains reduced and you suffer disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Drinking firewine that has been diluted with ale does not provide any of these effects.</p>

	<element name="Moaning Crown of Ndulu" type="Magic Item" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_MAGIC_ITEM_MOANING_CROWN_OF_NDULU">
		<description>
			<p>The Moaning Crown of Ndulu is a shadowy replica of the Crown of Narfell, the regal headpiece worn by the Nentyarchs of the ancient Empire of Narfell. The legendary paladin Sarshel Elethlim sundered the Crown of Narfell in the Year of Visions (731 DR) and unleashed the souls of the Nentyarchs that had been trapped within.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ndulu, a balor in the service of Orcus, spent a half century hunting down each of the crown-wraiths that had escaped from the broken crown. Ndulu channeled the Prince of Undeath’s fiendish power to forge the Moaning Crown of Ndulu from these wraiths.</p>
			<p class="indent">The crown appears as a roiling cloud of black smoke resting atop its wearer. Close inspection reveals occasional glimpses of the tortured faces of those bound within.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ethereal Form.</em></strong> The crown is ethereal and can only be affected or handled by effects or creatures that extend to the Ethereal Plane.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Deathly Taint.</em></strong> Anyone touching the ethereal form of the Moaning Crown of Ndulu is embraced by the wraiths bound within. For each turn that you touch the crown, you take 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. Every time you take damage, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have your hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You die if this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0 and your spirit is absorbed into the crown.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Evil Moan.</em></strong> The wraiths bound within the crown emit a continuous evil moan. While your are attuned to the crown, any non-evil creature within a 15-foot radius of you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the frightened creature has line of sight to the crown, then it has disadvantage on saving throws to end this effect. If the creature succeeds on a saving throw against this effect, they are immune to the crown’s Evil Moan feature for the next 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Terrifying Scream.</em></strong> You may use an action to invoke a soul-rending scream from the crown. Constructs and undead are immune to this feature. All other creatures within 30 feet who can hear this scream must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. Once used, you cannot again use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Moaning Crown of Ndulu possesses a communal intelligence forged from the wraiths that make up the ethereal crown. It is chaotic evil and has an Intelligence of 16, Wisdom of 14, and Charisma of 15.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to this item, you can hear these wraiths speak to you, while all other creatures only hear the susurrus of their moaning.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The wraiths trapped in the crown yearn to break free of their imprisonment. They despise all people of faith, particularly followers of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater. They have a special hatred for paladins devoted to these deities.</p>

			<p>The Demon Lord Eltab is said to have always carried this massive greatsword from the time of his first binding by Narfelli Demonbinders in the Year of the Starry Shroud (-153 DR).</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon is a giant-sized great sword that requires great strength to use effectively. Anyone with a Strength score of 14 or lower has disadvantage on all attack rolls made with Stormsplitter.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Also, because of the sword’s massive size, it deals 2d8 points of damage on a hit, instead of a greatsword’s normal damage. On a successful hit, the target and up to two other creatures of your choice within 15 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, or take 5 (1d10) points of lightning damage. Attacks with Stormsplitter score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Witchboats are a common sight on the waterways of Rashemen. They are typically small wooden boats that can hold three to four people (as per a rowboat), though larger warboats (equivalent to longships) are known to exist as well. These boats are crafted by Rashemani spellcasters who call upon the spirits of the land to enchant the watercraft. No working versions of these vessels have been seen outside of Rashemen.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the witchboat is floating in a body of water, and you are within 5 feet of the vessel, you may speak the command word as a bonus action to cause the boat to perform one of the following:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Move.</em></strong> The vessel moves at a rate of 30 feet per turn across water in any direction. This movement speed is unaffected by water currents.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Stop.</em></strong> The vessel stops any movement and remains stationary regardless of current.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Return.</em></strong> The vessel returns to its most recent previous location even if empty.</p>
