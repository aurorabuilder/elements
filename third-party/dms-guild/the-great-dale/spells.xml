		<supports>Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You create one to four 3-foot diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the weaker each sphere is individually. Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created. (4 spheres = 2d4, 3 spheres = 2d6, 2 spheres = 5d4, 1 sphere = 4d12).</p>

			<p>This spell snares a creature within range in a tangle of invisible, razor-sharp briars made of mystical energy. The affected creature suffers no ill effects as long as it does not attempt to move, attack, cast a spell with material or somatic components, or perform any other action that requires movement. If the target moves in any fashion, it takes 2d8 piercing damage. Damage from the spell disrupts spellcasting; a subject that attempts to cast a spell with a material or somatic component must make a concentration check, with a DC equal to 10 + spell level + damage dealt); on a failure the spell is not cast and the spell slot is still expended.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and it’s range increases by 10 feet for every slot above 4th.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You assume the form of a demon with a challenge rating equal to half your level (rounded down). You must have seen the type of demon at least once before or the spell fails. You transform into an average example of the demon you chose for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the demon you chose, but you don’t gain any of its spellcasting abilities. You retain your own alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies in addition to gaining those of the creature. You can’t use any of the creature’s legendary or lair actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert due to dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. If the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">You retain the benefit of any features of your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided your new form can also use them. However, you can’t use any special senses of your normal form unless your new form also possesses them. You can only speak if the creature can also speak.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear any equipment based on its shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form and must fall to the ground or merge if it can’t be worn. Equipment that merges with the new form doesn’t have an effect in that state.</p>
