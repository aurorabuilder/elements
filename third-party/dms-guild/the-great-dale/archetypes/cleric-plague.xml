			<p>It is common when sickness and disease strikes a village or township for people to cower away from it. They fear the touch of the illness, fear that it might affect them too. Clerics following the Plague Domain have no such fear. They live to study the morbid steps of deadly diseases, combating them when they know how to, or perhaps letting the infection run its course with little hindrance. For some Plague Clerics, the information gained from the painful decay of a subject is sweeter than the blessed administration of a divine cure.</p>

			<p>At 2nd level, a flow of death and decay exudes from you as you present your holy symbol. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to make a 10-foot cube of mist appear centered on a point within 30 feet of you. Any creature standing within the mist immediately starts having a coughing fit and must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, if it fails the saving throw, it must use its reaction to step out of the mist by the safest, most direct route, as it attempts to stagger away from the deadly gas. If there is no room for it to get out, it will remain in the mist even if it failed the save.</p>
