			<p>The wizards of ancient Narfell used powerful conjuration magic to summon demons and bind them into service. Through these dark pacts, the Nar demonbinders—as they were known—rose to greatness for a time. However, their demonic alliances couldn’t save them from destruction in their war against Raumathar. Shattered in the ruin of war, the alliances were broken, and the demons scattered throughout Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr. Many of the demons found places to slumber in the darkest parts of the forests where they wait to be awakened again. Some of those demons still reside beneath the ruins of ancient towers where they were bound to serve powerful demonbinders.</p>
			<p class="indent">Much of the lore of the Nar Demonbinders lies within ancient ruins along with the demons who once served there. Some of the lore has been discovered through excavations by cultists who wish to resurrect the ancient traditions of Narfell, and some has been recovered by foolhardy adventurers looking for treasure. This lore often consists of books detailing the rituals used to bind demons, or the methods of crafting specialized arcane foci to strengthen conjuration and abjuration spells used to summon and protect against demons. The greatest of the lost lore details how to tap into the Abyss itself to empower destructive spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wizards who study the lore of ancient Narfell can choose the Nar demonbinder arcane tradition and gain the following benefits as they unlock lost secrets.</p>

			<p>At 2nd level, you can spend 24 hours to craft an amulet using 50 gold pieces worth of materials that bolsters your protection against certain types of creatures and substitutes for the material components of the protection from evil and good spell. While you’re affected by that spell, creatures you’re protected against must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spellcasting DC if they wish to attack you or target you with a hostile action while you’re wearing the amulet. On a failed save, they must select a different target. You can only benefit from one enchanted amulet you have crafted at a time, and it only works for you.</p>
