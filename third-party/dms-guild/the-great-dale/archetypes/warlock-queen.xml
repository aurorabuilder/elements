		<description>
			<p>This Unseelie queen is an invisible and evil fey presence in the heart of Pandemonium. She is served by many types of evil creatures, notably corrupted fey, elves, and undead. Those who are able to discern her physical form describe her as a fey woman with white skin and pitch-black hair and eyes. Once a good sister to Titania, the Queen of Air and Darkness now seeks the corruption and death of the Seelie Court.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Queen of Air and Darkness is a being of hate and malevolence. Though she is considered chaotic evil, the Queen is a being of calculated patience and cold, emotionless plotting. She favors darkness and illusion, and her methods of corruption center on wearing down an opponent’s will to resist over time. Warlocks who take her as a patron may be given tasks that fit into a larger, often indiscernible long-term plan. Those who displease her are unlikely to be struck down in wrath; she is far more likely to send creatures such as yeth hounds to torment.</p>

	<!-- <element name="Titania" type="Archetype" source="The Great Dale" id="ID_DMSG_TGD_ARCHETYPE_TITANIA">
		<supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Faerie Queen of the Seelie Court, Titania is the opposite of her sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness. She is a ruler of the fey and is especially revered by pixies and sprites, who see her as their deity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Titania is a creature of good, though she is capable of great wrath when battling against true evil or when defending fey lands. Though one of the most powerful fey, and a likely patron to numerous warlocks, her constant duties as ruler of the Summer Court make her personal involvement in a warlock’s affairs unlikely. She is much more likely to work through one of her innumerable and loyal fey servants.</p>
