			<p>Where many rogues focus on deception and guile, you are not one of them. You reinforce verbal threats with acts of violence. You excel at inciting fear in those who oppose you. You know the best way to strike with a club and mace and you have discovered that the application of pain is an effective motivator when dealing with uncooperative individuals.</p>

			<p>Starting at 13th level, your skill at intimidating others is so effective that you can now frighten crowds. You may use a bonus action to attempt to frighten groups of creatures with threats of violence. Using a bonus action, you may force all creatures within a 30-foot cone who can see or hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, creatures are frightened of you for up to 1 minute.</p>
