			<p>The city of Sarshel in Impiltur is named after Sarshel Elethlim, a legendary paladin crowned King of Impiltur in the Year of the Proud Father (732 DR).</p>
			<p class="indent">Sarshel was a veteran of countless battles against the demon hordes that assailed the Realms during the 700’s DR. He wielded the mythic blade, Dornavver, more commonly referred to as Demonbane, and was one of the few survivors of the siege of Myth Drannor in the Year of Doom (714 DR). His greatest achievement arguably occurred in the Year of Visions (731 DR), when he shattered the Crown of Narfell, defeating the balor Ndulu beneath the Citadel of Conjurers.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of Sarshel’s enduring legacies is the founding of an elite order of paladins who follow a set of oaths he established during the Triad Crusades. These tenets focus on the elimination of fiendish and undead creatures that still threaten Impiltur and the eastern reaches of Faerûn.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF SARSHEL</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Sarshel demand that paladins face the threats of fiends and undead with relentless courage and be unwavering in the crusade against these evils.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Pursuit of Evil.</em></strong> You will relentlessly hunt any fiends that threaten the land until they are no more.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Defend the Realms.</em></strong> You will never falter in defending the land from those who would destroy all that is good.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Preserve Hope.</em></strong> You will be a shining example of honor, justice, and courage to those who fight by your side.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessed Weapon.</em></strong> As an action you can use your Channel Divinity to enchant a weapon you carry with divine power. For 1 minute this weapon deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage on a successful attack and is considered a magical weapon. The enchanted weapon glows, providing bright light out to a 20-foot radius and dim light a further 20 feet beyond.</p>
			<p class="idnent">You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Inspire the Faithful.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to encourage an ally to resist the foes who assail them. As a bonus action, you may inspire one creature other than yourself who is within 60 feet of you for one minute to make all saving throws with advantage.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>On your turn, you can choose to have one of your weapon attacks ignore any damage resistance the target may have. If the target is normally immune to the damage type inflicted by this weapon attack, that creature is instead only resistant to that damage. You may choose to apply this effect after you determine if your attack hits or misses.</li>
