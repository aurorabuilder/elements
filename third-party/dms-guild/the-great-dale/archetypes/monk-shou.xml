			<p>The varied peoples of Kara-Tur have a long and storied history of using the study of martial arts to attain enlightenment. Monasteries exist where students spend their lives trying to achieve spiritual perfection.</p>
			<p class="indent">But not all are so dedicated to enlightenment. Some seek to focus on the practical aspects of martial combat. This is particularly evident by those who have left monasteries or never fully dedicated themselves to a teacher or their ideas. Many of the Shou refugees who settled in Thesk after fleeing the Tuigan Horde fall into this category. These individuals care less about self-actualization and more about surviving the attacks of thugs from the Nine Golden Swords.</p>

			<p>Although you have studied the unarmored defense techniques of the fighting monks of Kara-Tur, you recognize the value of armor and weapons.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 3rd level, all finesse weapons are considered monk weapons for you. Additionally, you gain proficiency with all melee and ranged martial weapons, but unless specified otherwise these are not considered monk weapons for you.</p>
			<p class="indent">You also gain proficiency with light armor. You may use your Martial Arts feature while wearing light armor. Although you cannot benefit from your Unarmored Defense or Unarmored Movement features while wearing armor, you are still faster than most and your speed increases by 5 feet while wearing light armor.</p>
