		<description>
			<p>The Circle of Leth is an order of druids formed in the Year of the Last Hunt (722 DR). In that year, The Great Druid of Leth claimed the title of Nentyarch and grew a living fortress of trees atop the fiend-corrupted ruins of Dun-Tharos. This druid circle protected the Great Dale from all threats until the Year of the Unstrung Harp (1371 DR) when they were cast out of Dun-Tharos by the Rotting Man and his Blightlords. The Rotting Man’s reign in Dun-Tharos did not last long, for he and his Rotting Lords were destroyed by demons from below Dun-Tharos, who now overrun the wilds of Dunwood.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Nentyarch and his followers found refuge to the south, in the ancient wood elf fortress of Yeshelmaar. From this bastion in the Forest of Lethyr, the Circle of Leth seeks to purge Dunwood of its evil fiendish taint while protecting the goodly folks of the Great Dale.</p>
			<p class="indent">Druids of the Circle of Leth have a strong affinity for nature and the untamed plants and creatures that live therein. They call on nature’s divine essence to transform into plant creatures to help defend their forest homes.</p>
			<h5>In Other Settings</h5>
			<p>The druids of the Circle of Leth easily fit into any setting that already has a strong druidic tradition and wide regions of unspoiled vegetation.</p>
