			<p>The Circle of Blight is made up of devotees of Talona and the Rotting Man. Feared and reviled throughout the Great Dale, they revel in decay. Their plagues have transformed the Dunwood into a nightmarish swamp, and they seek to infect the healthy forests and tilled lands nearby.</p>
			<p class="indent">Greatly reduced in number after the Rotting Man was driven out of Dun-Tharos a century ago, Blightlords remain individually powerful thanks to his legacy, and still walk the Great Dale and beyond, bringing degeneration and putrefaction wherever they step.</p>

			<p>Your devotion to decay grants you access to certain spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn the infestation cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Blight Spells table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

In addition, blightspawned creatures you encounter don’t attack you unless you attack them first, and any animal companions you might have or creatures you summon may gain the blightspawned template (see Chapter 10).</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 2nd level, you can use your Blight Touch to infect a living creature with Talona’s Blight.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature you touch must make a Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC or become infected. It takes 1d4 days for Talona’s Blight symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and nausea. The infected creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion, and it does not regain hit points from spending Hit Dice during a rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must repeat the Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature dies from Talona’s Blight, it arises as a blightspawned creature (see Chapter 10) under your control.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this ability you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 10th level, your Black Glaive attacks become even more horrible and difficult to heal. A creature you hit with your glaive takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for every successful attack you make against it. This damage persists until another creature within 5 feet of the creature uses its action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC or the creature receives magical healing. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way dies immediately and rises at the start of its next turn as a blightspawned zombie under your control. The blightspawned zombine template is found in Chapter 10.</p>
