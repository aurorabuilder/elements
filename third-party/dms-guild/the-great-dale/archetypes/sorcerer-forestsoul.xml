			<p>A few special mortals may claim to possess a forest soul. Perhaps in the distant past the blood of your ancestors mingled with peoples of the forest. Many with fey ancestry can lay claim to a lineage that includes enchanted creatures of the sylvan realms. Whatever the source, you are one with the trees.</p>
			<p class="indent">You are comforted being around vibrant woodlands where healthy trees still spread their branches across the land. Conversely, your soul aches whenever living trees are cut down and when darkness, sickness, or rot infests the woods that you love.</p>
			<p class="indent">Normally those with a strong connection to the land might seek the teachings of druidic circles, but you were not one of these. Instead, the natural powers of the woodlands feed you with arcane power and magical talent that few comprehend.</p>

			<p>Your link to the forest and its natural spirits allow you to learn spells from the druid class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you learn the entangle spell. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesnâ€™t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the druid spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 2nd level, you may use a bonus action to create a spell slot using half the number of sorcery points normally required, to cast a spell you know from the druid spell list. This spell must be cast during that same turn as your bonus action. This spell slot is lost if you do not cast the spell by the end of your turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.</p>
