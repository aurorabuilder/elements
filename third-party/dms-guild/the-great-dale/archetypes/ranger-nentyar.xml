			<p>The Nentyar archdruid of the Circle of Leth grants unique primal abilities to a special conclave of rangers in their employ. These rangers master a greater command of druidic and totemic powers. Using these gifts, the Nentyar Hunters, as they are called, root out evil that would threaten the forest and the natural order.</p>
			<h5>In Other Settings</h5>
			<p class="indent">Outside the Forgotten Realms, these rangers are referred to as Wildheart Striders, named for their greater connection to the natural world. In worlds such as Eberron, these rangers serve the druids in the Eldeen Reaches. In Ravnica, these rangers might be guardians of the Selesnya Conclave’s guildhall, Vitu- Ghazi, or gifted scouts of the Gruul Clans. However you might choose to use them, these rangers are often considered champions of the primeval.</p>
