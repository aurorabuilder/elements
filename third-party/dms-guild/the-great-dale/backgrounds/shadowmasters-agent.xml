		<description>
			<p>You’re an agent of the Shadowmasters of Telflamm, a thieves’ guild that is strongly linked to the worship of Shar. The Shadowmasters rule Telflamm in secret through their web of spies and thieves, rivaling the influence and power of the local nobility and clergy. You are, or at least were, just one tendril of the sprawling shadow that the Shadowmasters cast over the city. You might have even briefly escaped the guild and its machinations, but, willingly or not, everywhere you go, you further the seedy agenda of the guild’s elite, the shadowlords.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Religion, and choose one from Deception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Thieves’ Tools</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, a holy symbol of Shar, black priestly robes, a Shadowmaster guild insignia and 10 gp in a belt pouch.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Shadowmasters of Telflamm are, by definition, members of a crime syndicate. Their devotion to Shar, Mistress of Night, is a common trait, and tends to color their attitudes and practices. Shadowmasters tend to be cunning, ruthless, shrewd, and, most of all, deceitful. You can use the following traits to flesh out your shadowmaster character or to draw inspiration from to create your own.</p>

			<p>The Shadowmasters are adept at gathering information and have eyes and ears everywhere. In every town, city, or other settlement, you know of another Shadowmaster Agent who you can rely on to fill you in on basic information about the settlement’s main features, figures, locations, and organizations, as well as other underworld activity in that settlement.</p>
