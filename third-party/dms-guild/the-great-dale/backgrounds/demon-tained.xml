		<description>
			<p>At some point, you were corrupted by the powers of the Abyss, and your very being was pierced to the core by dark energies. Now you wander as a pariah, haunted by the event that made you this way. Now you have turned to adventuring to either win the favor of the people through deed, or find enough coin to sway anyone that might judge you for what you have become. You might flinch at what they call you, or embrace it. Either way, it is difficult to hide that you are “demon tainted.”</p>

				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Religion, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> any one tool proficiency</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Abyssal</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Traveler’s clothes, a hooded cloak, a staff, a small memento from your previous life, and a leather pouch containing 10 gp.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>DARK ORIGIN</h5>
			<p>The moment when your life force was corrupted by demonic powers is what made you who you are today. That moment changed you forever, maybe through your own doing, or someone else’s. Choose a dark origin, or roll on the Dark Origin table to determine the event that changed you.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d10</td><td>Dark Origin</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>You tried to bargain for power, and in turn the demon you bargained with took a few liberties with the idea of granting you power.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>You were intended as a sacrifice to a Demon Prince, but instead became their champion.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>In a moment of trauma, the demonic ancestry in your bloodline manifested.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>You were born this way, and were raised far away from society’s judgemental eyes.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You took an unexpected trip to the Abyss, and did not return the same person.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>After stealing a dark tome belonging to your master, you attempted to cast a spell from it, and things went horribly awry.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Little did you know, your past lover had actually been a demon, and their presence slowly changed you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>After having scorned a powerful spellcaster, this cursed form manifested over time.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9</td><td>You made a bet with a demon and lost.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10</td><td>After a night of debauchery, you woke up to find yourself like this.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h5>DEMONIC MARK</h5>
			<p>The tainted nature of your being has its own physical manifestation that gives away what you are. You can choose one of the following from the Demonic Marks table, or roll for one. Alternatively, you might choose to create your own.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d8</td><td>Demonic Mark</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>One or more of your limbs turned red and demon-like.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Your eyes resemble that of a goat’s and glow red in the dark.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>You have a second mouth somewhere on your body that incessantly mumbles and whispers words of disaster in Abyssal.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Long curled horns sprout from your forehead and a spaded tail extends from your lower back.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Parts of your body look charred and ashen and you always smell of smoke.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>A ghastly unblinking eye sits in the middle of your forehead. Although you can’t see through it, you get the sinking feeling someone or something else can.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Your body is covered in Abyssal runes that glow faintly in the presence of divine magic.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>Your tongue is forked and vestigial wings sprout from your shoulder blades.</td></tr>

			<h5>SPELL LIST</h5>
			<p>If you are a spellcaster, the spells on the Demon Tainted Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)</p>
			<p class="caption">Demon Tainted Spells Table</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>Cantrip</td><td><em>chill touch, produce flame, thaumaturgy</em></td></tr>
				<tr><td>1st</td><td><em>burning hands, hellish rebuke, inflict wounds</em></td></tr>
				<tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>crown of madness, darkness, flaming sphere</em></td></tr>

			<p class="indent">When you cast spells from your Demon-tainted spell list, the air around you might grow hot, your eyes might glow, or other signs of demonic power. Each of these spells as you cast them are far from subtle.</p>
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Demon-tainted characters, underneath their unusual appearance and dark histories, are still people. Although you might draw your powers from darkness, nothing dictates that your character is truly evil. In fact, you might be drawn to try to find healing and closure through good deeds. Alternatively, your character could feel drawn to darker ambitions and deeds as they struggle with the pull of the supernatural corruption within them.</p>
