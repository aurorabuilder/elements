		<description>
			<p>The Circle of Leth and their force of Nentyar Hunters have protected the Dalesfolk and the forests of the land for hundreds of years.</p>
			<p class="indent">This group is overseen by the Nentyarch, an archdruid of remarkable power who oversees these groups from an old wood elf stronghold at Yeshelmaar in the Forest of Lethyr.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Nentyarch Follower you respect the Circle of Leth. You believe in the sanctity of the great forests surrounding the Dale and you hope to purge the land of the fiendish hosts that still infect it. Honest people of the Dale should be protected, but the spread of civilization shouldn’t call for the felling of further forest. Nature itself needs protection from the depredations of those who do not place enough value on its continued existence.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Nature, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One artisan tool of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Sylvan</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A hunting knife, a healer’s kit, a set of traveler’s clothes, a sprig of mistletoe, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.</li>

		<description>
			<p>The Nentyarch and the Circle of Leth have long looked after the people of the Great Dale. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate within any of the many small villages or farmsteads that exists in the Great Dale and the Forest of Lethyr, provided you have not shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from anyone who might oppose the Nentyarch or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.</p>
