			<p>You return a dead beast you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 8 hours. If the beast’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the beast returns to life with half of its total hit points, rejuvenated by the blessing of Silvanus. </p>
			<p class="indent">This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the beast at the time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the beast returns to life.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival - its head, for instance - the spell automatically fails.</p>

If a swarm is alive after 8 hours, you will lose your control over it and the swarm will disband into an appropriate number of tiny rats. You can recast the spell before it expires to regain control over the swarm again. The DM has the swarms’ statistics (swarm of rats with 216 hit points). </p>

You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. </p>
			<p class="indent">To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.

			<p>An icy chill passes over your body, giving you a better understanding of winter’s fury. For the duration, when you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you cause your target to become vulnerable to this damage type for the attack. When you cast any spells that deal cold damage to a target that is resistant to that damage type, you cause the target to lose their resistance to cold damage for the attack. When you cast any spells that deal cold damage on a target that is immune to this damage type, you cause your target to become resistant for the attack instead. </p>

The resulting pool has a depth of 10 feet and is difficult terrain. The area looks like a shallow pool of water at first glance, and any creature that was not aware of the spell being cast must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell DC to believe otherwise before contact is made with the pool.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature entering the pool for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on a failed save and sinking into the pool, as the grappled condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much acid damage and is not grappled. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A creature of size Large or smaller that fails the saving throw while already grappled by the pool is also restrained against your spell save DC. </p>
			<p class="indent">A restrained creature can’t breathe, and any non-magical metal objects it carries begin to corrode. When the restrained creature takes acid damage from the pool, non-magical metal weapons and armor take a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty to their damage rolls and AC, respectively. If this penalty on a weapon reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed; similarly, armor is destroyed if its AC is reduced to 10. Other metal objects take cumulative damage as well, as the pool eats through a 1- inch-thickness of non-magical metal each round it is immersed. </p>

			<p>You point an outstretched hand with fingers spread and emanate a blanket of necrotic energy from your fingertips. Each creature that you choose in a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d12 necrotic damage and suffers 2 levels of exhaustion on a failed save, as their bones become frail and strength leaves their body. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and do not become exhausted but become frightened of you until the end of their next turn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You bury a gemstone 1 foot below the surface and begin to enchant the surrounding area with magical energies native to the Elemental Plane of Air. After a strenuous casting recital consisting of 8 hours of uninterrupted devotion, the landscape begins to tear away from its surroundings up to a 250-foot-radius sphere in any direction from the gemstone, forming an island. </p>
			<p class="indent">Once the spell has been completed, the island begins to lift into the air at a rate of 100 feet per 1 hour. You are able to use your action to stop the island from elevating at any point up to 1 mile above the surface. Once stopped, you are able to move the island by spending 1 hour in an uninterrupted recitation. Doing so will allow you to move the island in any direction at a rate of 20 feet per 1 hour. You may stop the island from moving at any time using your action. The buried gemstone can never be higher than 1 mile above the surrounding ground’s surface. Removing the gemstone from the place it was buried requires a successful Intelligence (Arcana) and Strength (Athletic) check, each contested by your spell save DC. Succeeding on both checks ends the spell, causing the island to fall back towards the surface at a rate of 192 feet per round. </p>
			<p class="indent">You may only have one instance of this spell active at a time. Casting the spell again will cause the other casting of this spell to lose its magical properties and the spell will end. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a slot of 9th level, you may have multiple instances of this spell active at a time, and casting the spell again no longer causes previous castings of this spell to end. When you complete the 1-hour recitation to move a Levitated Landscape, you instead move all Levitated Landscapes that you control. </p>

			<p>You touch a willing creature and strengthen its resolve, allowing it to become dauntless in the face of untold danger. For the duration, the target becomes immune to all conditions. If the target is currently affected with any condition other than exhaustion or is unconscious, casting this spell will remove those conditions from the target. Additionally, if a single source of damage would kill the target while the spell is active, the target’s health is set to 1 hit point instead, and the spell ends.</p>

			<p>This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and merges it with your own. A possessed soul remains merged with your own until the spell ends or until you release, which ends the spell. While you possess a soul, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a possess soul up to ten times. Once you exploit a soul for the tenth time, you have the option to release it or destroy it, and the spell ends. While a soul is possessed, the dead humanoid it came from can’t be revived. </p>
			<p class="indent">You are able to use an action on your turn to invoke one of the following properties, which lasts for 24 hours. You can only have one property active at a time. If you invoke a new property while one is active, the active one ends and is replaced by the new one</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Assimilate.</b></i> You gain one of the creature’s traits (your choice). </p>

			<p class="indent"><i><b>Cognizance.</b></i> If the creature had blind sense, tremor sense or true sight you gain that ability.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i><b>Pathfinding.</b></i> You gain the creature’s movement speed, which is added to your own. If the target could fly, swim, climb, or burrow you gain the ability to do so as well. </p>

			<p>You embed the soul and personality of a willing target into an item. While affected by this spell, the target doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age or die. It retains its senses. Divination spells can’t locate or perceive the target.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s perception of the vessel may vary and is chosen by the caster as they form a mental image of the target’s place of voluntary imprisonment. The target will be able to verbally communicate with creatures outside of the vessel, and to communicate telepathically with creatures attuned to the item. While within the vessel, the target may summon any mundane items they desire.</p>
			<p class="indent">The item used as a vessel gains a magical aura about it and is inured to wear and damage. It also has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and resistant to damage originating from such. The item uses the statistics of the bound creature for saving throws, and the maximum value of the bound creature’s Hit Dice (including its Constitution modifier) for determining the item’s HP. Its AC is 25, and any damage to it is repaired at a rate of 5 HP per round. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ending the Spell.</em></strong> The spell may be ended through a ceremonial ritual where diamonds worth at least 500gp per Hit Die of the bound target are fired in a brazier for 24 hours, stoked and fueled with rare herbs native to the target’s place of birth. The item must be laid upon the diamonds for the duration of the ceremony, and the true name of the target chanted at its zenith. Performing this ritual will expunge the target’s soul from the item, releasing it to its expected destination upon death, and destroying the possessed item along with all resources used in the ritual. </p>
			<p class="indent">A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting the item.</p>

			<p>You utter a phrase so baneful that it pains those who hear it, possibly even killing them. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 psychic damage when the spell is cast, and then again at the start of each of its turn for the duration. Additionally, it suffers an effect based on its current hit points:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>90 hit points or less: incapacitated for the duration</li>
			<li>70 hit points or less: stunned for the duration</li>
			<li>50 hit points or less: paralyzed for the duration</li>
			<li>30 hit points or less: killed instantly</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">At any point during the spell’s duration, if an affected creature’s current hit points are reduced to a point that would cause it to suffer a different effect, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers the new effect. On a success, the spell ends for that creature.</p>

			<p>You create a shadowy pool centered on a flat surface that you can see within range. The pool is 30 feet in diameter and connects your plane to the Shadowfell. A spectral hand rises from the center of the pool and remains there for the duration of the spell. The spectral hand does not occupy its space.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a creature enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 10d12 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a success. Any creature that is reduced to 0 hit points while in the pool sinks to the bottom and is immediately transported to the Plane of Shadow, becoming trapped there.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you may command the spectral hand to beckon a creature within 120 feet of it. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or have an enchantment placed upon it, causing it to approach the spectral hand. The creature must spend its turns trying to move as close to the spectral hand as it can, using the Dash action. </p>
			<p class="indent">A creature enchanted in this manner can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the enchantment ends and the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If it fails its save three times, it becomes stunned and the enchantment ends. The spectral hand can only enchant one target at a time in this manner. </p>

If the target dies during the duration, for any reason except old age, the blessing is triggered. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life at the start of its next turn with hit points equal to half its hit point maximum. As a bonus action on the same turn, the target can expend as many of its hit dice as it chooses to heal itself. Roll each die spent, adding your Constitution modifier to each, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total. </p>
