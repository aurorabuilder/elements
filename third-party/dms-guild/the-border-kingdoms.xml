		<description>
			<p>According to the sage Meriadas of Westgate: “The Border Kingdoms are the most favored destination for adventurers who want to proudly and boldly conquer a realm or establish their own new kingdom. Lords, counts, dukes, kings and emperors rise, proclaim themselves, and are swept away with the speed and regularity of waves crashing upon a shore.”</p>
			<p>A legendary “frontier” corner of the Forgotten Realms, the Border Kingdoms are where adventurers come to carve out their own kingdom, flee retribution, hide treasure — or find someone else's treasure.</p>
			<p>It is a hodgepodge of tiny realms ruled by kings, grand viziers, imperial overdukes, and all manner of cabals, councils, and self-titled nobles. It's full of ruins, folk who want to stay hidden, long-slumbering secrets, and adventures waiting to happen.</p>
			<p>The Border Kingdoms is a valuable resource for Dungeon Masters and players alike. In addition to describing the people and places of the Border Kingdoms, this book contains enough adventure hooks and lore to keep adventuring parties busy for years.</p>
			<p><strong><em>The Border Kingdoms is an officially-approved Wizards of the Coast release, meaning that its content is Adventurers League legal and all the lore contained in the book is official Forgotten Realms canon!</em></strong></p>

		<description>
			<p>You are a descendant of someone—likely in or near the Border Kingdom known as High Mukshar—who came into intimate personal contact with a member of a druuth (a band of doppelgangers led by an mind flayer) and survived.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Druuthguard tend to be suspicious of strangers and generally distrustful. However, once they have decided someone is true and reliable, they are usually staunch friends and allies. They generally carry an “us vs. them” mentality due to their family’s past. Druuthguard tend to examine strangers critically assessing whether or not they represent an immediate threat or are hiding something sinister or dangerous.</p>

			<p>As a result of your hereditary exposure to such creatures, whenever you’re in the company of a shapeshifter (doppelganger, lycanthrope, etc.) you sense that something is “odd” about them. You can’t tell precisely what kind of shapeshifter they are, but you know they are one.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You have become one of the rare few who have walked the trails and trackless tangles of the largest and wildest forest in the Border Kingdoms, and survived its plentiful monsters long enough to gain not just woodcraft, but a mastery of the secrets unique to the Duskwood, its waterflows and prevalent breezes, its topography and hidden caverns (all of them beast-lairs, these days), and the habitual hunting ranges of its most formidable monstrous inhabitants. You can hunt, guide, trap and find your way through the Duskwood with a far lower chance of getting lost than others, and you know where specific beasts (and types of flora) are most likely to be found; enough to make a living from this.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Nature, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Woodcarvers tools</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A forester’s axe, a hunting trap, a journal containing notes on specific locations of rare and sought-after flora and fauna, a set of forester’s clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>WOODSAGE</h5>
			<p>As a Duskwood forester, you are a woodcutter who within the canopy of the Duskwood, knows the properties of types of woods, and how to correctly identify trees, vines, berries, bushes, and herbs; can recognize most plant blights and what creatures left what marks when feeding, claw-sharpening, or passing; knows the trails and sites of the Duskwood (including routes to the magical pools of the Deep Duskwood); is familiar with the perils of the Vauntagar; has some mastery of what in the forest is poisonous and what antidotes and remedies the Duskwood holds; and knows something of the magic of the forest’s fabled enchanted pools.</p>
			<div element="ID_DMSG_TBK_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_DUSKWOOD_FORESTER_NATURALIST_GUIDE" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>The life of a duskwood forester tends to be a solitary one. As a result, many duskwood foresters tend to be reserved in demeanor, given to silences, and are blunt and gruff in speech. Foresters are not ones for many of the refinements prized by urban society, and are more comfortable sleeping out of doors than in a bed.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Secrets Duskwood Foresters Know</h5>
				<p>Long ago, the Duskwood hosted a ferocious magical battle. Mighty spells were hurled and magic items exploded, scattering raw magical energies. Some sank into leaves, bark, and roots. Most of the trees, shrubs, and vines radiate no magic today, but can have strange properties.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a result of this strange experience with the apparition of Skulls Hallow, you are an unwilling seer, of sorts. Visions of the past and messages about the future come to you unbidden and for no apparent reason. More frustrating than that is trying to figure out what these glimpses from other times and places mean. Occasionally, these visions and messages are easy to understand and can be quite helpful. However, more commonly, these random insights are inscrutable and confusing. Your DM may privately impart Skull messages to you from time to time.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You are of the bloodline of a family who lived for generations in the hot forest of Jundarwood (also known as “Old Shadow”) in the western Border Kingdoms, and through drinking its waters and eating its fastgrowing plants and small animals, gained the trait of healing swiftly and even regenerating lost organs, limbs, and other body parts. Like other Jundarls, your hair and nails grow with astonishing speed, so if you don’t trim often, you’re always shaggy, and if you “let yourself go” can become as hairy as a bear (concealing your facial features and hiding tattoos and scars), with nails like (brittle, low- strength) bear-claws.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Jundarl tend to be on the reclusive side simply as a function of their appearance. However, they are certainly not solitary individuals by default. Given assiduous and daily grooming, one would never be able to tell a Jundarl apart from any other Borderer. Those Jundarl who weary from the necessary trimming and cutting that is required to blend into “normal” society tend to be loners who live in isolation. Because of their obvious physical differences from the rest of society, Jundarl are often wrongly accused of beastly behaviour, not unlike the bias faced by lycanthropes.</p>

		<description>
			<p>While the rapid growth of your hair and nails may have their drawbacks in civilized society, your body’s rapid healing makes getting over life’s everyday bumps and bruises a bit easier. At the end of a long rest, the jundarl gains a number of temporary hit points equal to their proficiency bonus. Given enough time, this unusual healing ability can actually regenerate lost digits or even whole body parts. However, this process is slow. The jundarl can regenerate approximately one pound of lost body parts/material for each month spent resting.</p>

			<h5>THE HUNT</h5>
			<p>You have spent your days mastering the craft of hunting animals and monsters, or pursuing or tracking them with the intent of doing so. Most of your hunting has been for procuring food or to remove predators in your community in which you live. You also have been hired as a guide to track and help kill some of the most dangerous monsters in the Border Kingdoms.</p>

			<p>Monster hunters are a diverse and colorful group who are experts on the flora and fauna of the wilds of the Border Kingdoms. They tend to be solitary, but not universally so. Their individual motivations can range from conservation to trophy hunting. All Monster Hunters are self reliant and very capable naturalists.</p>

				<h5>Derlusk Lore Scholars Know</h5>
				<p>Long, long ago, some of the text of the fabled Nether Scrolls was copied by an amanuensis who brought her copies to Derlusk, and recopied paragraphs or lone sentences into blank areas on the pages of existing tomes. Her writings have no magical power whatsoever, but share some of the mighty magical knowledge preserved on the famous Scrolls.</p>
				<p class="indent">In the early 1300s DR, a monk of Candlekeep made what we might call “backup copies” of some important texts, and smuggled them into Derlusk’s libraries.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You are from the Talduth Vale. What was once a series of independent towns and municipalities has now come under the hegemony of the Barony of Blacksaddle. The Barony rules the Vale with a heavy hand, which has stirred deep resentment against the Barony. For a folk used to freedom and independence, the taxes and administration for many have become an unacceptable burden. You have taken to a life of crime as a result. But you are no common brigand. You are focused on fomenting rebellion, stealing from those in positions of wealth and power, and then distributing this bounty to those most affected by the capricious rule of the Barony. As such, you are skilled at tactical planning, ambushes, and getaways (navigating the outdoors).</p>
			<p class="indent">You might be a classic Robin Hood who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, or you might be a rabble-rouser making trouble against any sort of authority. Whatever path you choose, you have contempt for law and order, and any form of governmental authority.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Scofflaws of Blacksaddle have one common feature, and that is contempt for governmental authority. They are usually outspoken about this fact and tend to surround themselves with like-minded people. Whether involved in grand plots to topple regional powers or simply trying to dodge the tax assessor, Scofflaws of Blacksaddle are consistent in their desire to foil governmental efforts.</p>

			<p>You frequently find yourself in tough spots so can be creative on the fly with whatever materials you have on hand. Being ingenious requires a pressing need; an inspiration other than boredom or curiosity. Such an attempt succeeds or fails based on the available materials, the situation, and the nature of the desired creation. Success requires both a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check and a successful tool check. The Investigation portion contemplates assembling the materials and their nature, and the tool check is necessary to actually accomplish the build.</p>

			<p>You grew up in the city of Yallasch, and so are personally trained in the making and repair of ropes and cables of all sizes, and/or of chains of all sizes, or of (canvas) sails, or shipbuilding (the construction, repair, sealing and resealing of hulls, and the making, seating, and repair of masts). Regardless of what you’ve been trained in, you are skilled in the erection of scaffolding, in the placement, construction, repair, and use of pulleys and guidelines—and so can readily load or unload cargoes to and from ship- holds or up and down great heights (castle walls or cliffs). You can roughly estimate breaking strains, load limits, weights, stresses, and the “sway” effects of winds or wind gusts of a given force.</p>
