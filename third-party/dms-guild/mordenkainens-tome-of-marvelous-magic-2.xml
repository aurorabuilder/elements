		<description>
			<p>This wand is made of three slender rods of silver entwined together, cradling a clear, spherical quartz near the tip.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wand has 2d6 + 20 charges when found. While holding it, you can use an action to transform the wand into any other wand with a rarity of rare or lower. It can only be transformed into a particular type of wand once, and behaves exactly like the wand it’s been transformed into, except it retains this property. Using any property of the wand expends the number of charges indicated in the wand’s description.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you expend the wand’s last charge, it shatters and is destroyed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This thin, orange oil is easily poured and can cover four Tiny objects, two Small objects, or one Medium object. Applying the oil takes 1 round, regardless of how many objects you cover.</p>
			<p class="indent">The covered objects animate and become creatures under your control for 1 minute or until reduced to 0 hit points. As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this oil if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). They can follow specific or general instructions.</p>

			<p class="indent">An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10, its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if it lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it’s destroyed.</p>

Each creature (other than the wearer) that’s completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This wooden rod looks like a cue. While holding this rod, you can use an action to attempt to shove a creature within 30 feet of you, either to knock it prone or to push it away from you. The target can’t be more than one size category larger than you. The rod grows long enough to contact the target and then immediately returns to normal size.</p>
			<p class="indent">Make a spellcasting ability check (add your proficiency bonus) contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 10 feet away from you.</p>
