			<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your ki energy to toss your foes about with ease. When you shove a creature, you can increase the distance you push the target by spending ki points. Each point you spend increases the distance you push the target by 10 feet. The maximum number of ki points that you can spend on a shove equals half your monk level.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet it is pushed. The target lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the shove.</p>

			<p>Starting at 11th level, you have learned to exploit certain mystic pressure points on the body. As an action, you can spend 4 ki points and target a creature you are grappling. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls unconscious for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent">The effect ends early if the target takes damage, or someone uses an action to slap the target awake. A creature is immune to this effect if it is undead or if it cannot be charmed.</p>
