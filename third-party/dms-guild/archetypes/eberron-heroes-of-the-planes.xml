		<description>
			<p>Thirteen planes enwrap the world of Eberron. The world is as influenced by the planes as it is by its own magic. Manifest zones dots the world, sometimes harvested for their magic properties but always affecting anything that lives within them. This planar influence leads to the rise of planar warriors, heroes that draw their power from the planes.</p>
			<p>Eberron: Heroes of the Planes presents thirteen subclass options, one for each class, each themed after one of Eberron’s unique planes. Even the artificer found in Eberron: Rising from the Last War is represented here. Whether looking to master artifice or looking for a patron for shortcuts to arcane power, the planes offer adventurers a path to glory and greatness.</p>

			<p>Underlying reality is a fundamental imbalance. A randomness, an unpredictability. Some artificers, in the close attention they pay to crafted objects, discover this chaos. Kythri, the Churning Chaos, is a prime point of study for these chaoticians, who unravel some of the fundamental workings of existence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though these ideas may seem quite modern, the origin of this study stretches back to the Dhakaani goblinoid empire. In their attempts to fight back the daelkyr’s aberrant armies, the great craftsmen of the empire reached out to the planes themselves. Though the empire of the surface fell, survivors driven into Khyber have studied the strange nature of the Dragon Below, spawning powerful chaoticians among their ranks.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you can tap into the unstable chaos that forms the basis of existence. As a bonus action, you can choose a point you can see within 30 feet of you, creating a region of chaotic reality originating from that point. This region is a cube, 10 feet on each side, which is always considered dim light from the shifting of images seen through it.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a hostile creature in this zone of chaos rolls an attack roll or ability check, it must roll a d4 and subtract the result from that roll. Conversely, when a friendly creature in this zone makes an attack roll or ability check, it rolls a d4 and adds the result to that roll. This d4 becomes a d6 at 10th level.</p> 
			<p class="indent">When you create the zone and as a bonus action on your turns while it persists, you can control the zone, moving it up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice. You can then cause a bolt of energy to jump from the region. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 20 feet of your chaos zone. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The chaos zone lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it early as an action. Once you create a chaos zone, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher when you create it.</p>

If a creature is unwilling to move, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. The creature is not moved on a successful save.</p>

			<p>Before they rooted themselves beneath eastern Khorvaire, the dwarves of Mror lived among the frozen tundra and eternal blizzards of the Frostfell. To survive, one dwarven tribe forged a pact with a terrible presence found in every pebble of hail and every flake of snow, a presence known only as the Heart of Winter. Though that tribe is long since gone, the terrible nature of this pact persists, across descended dwarven lines and among others seeking power from the endless hunger of snow and ice.</p>
			<p class="indent">While some barbarians seek to emulate the beasts of nature or channel the spirits of their ancestors, those of the Winter Heart embrace the ever-hungering cold of Risia. Some are worshipers of the Devourer, seeing the divinity in nature’s wrathful blizzards and hailstorms. Others are cursed by the evil inherent to the Plain of Ice, through interactions with manifest zones or creatures from that plane. Though the cold eats away at them from the inside, barbarians of the Winter Heart are granted incredible strength and agility, devastating weapons against any foe.</p>

			<p>Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead. All cultures on Eberron have stories about the afterlife, of the endless gray that carries lost souls to the divine beyond or simply drags them into oblivion. Those that have divined this dire realm can sometimes hear a terrible chorus, a choir of lost souls babbling, whispering, and screaming as their memories fade into nothing: the Graysong.</p> <p class="indent">Those of the bardic college of the Graysong weave memories and souls to harness the power of this terrible sound. They listen to its overlapping lyrics to draw out the knowledge of lifetimes. These bards even channel this cacophony to strike fear into the hearts of other creatures. Many bards search for a deeper meaning in the afterlife through this study—surely, in those cries of agony and loss, there is some secret truth that makes mortal life less finite and makes its end less existentially horrifying. The alternative is simply too grave a truth to bear.</p>

			<p>To some clerics, the message of scripture is more important than the force behind it. They take inspiration not just from their holy books but from works of fiction, passed-down tales, and the fey of Thelanis themselves. As a cleric of the Story domain, you do not say prayers but instead recite passages of inspiring stories from memory. Your collection of books and scrolls is as important to the divine spark you draw power from as any holy symbol you bear.</p>
			<p class="indent">In Eberron, the scripture and communal lore of the Sovereign Host tell many great tales, such as Aureon and his Shadow, or the terrible tale of the Fury’s birth. The Silver Flame’s teachings are full of inspirational tales, from Tira Miron to the brave warriors of the Lycanthrope Purge. To kalashtar, the story of their ancestral spirit giving up everything to forge a brighter future takes center stage, forming the basis of their devotion to the Path of Light. Eberron and its history are full of inspiring tales, each a piece of a grander, unseen divinity.</p>

Some halflings in the Talenta Plains have learned similar stances, though with names closer to those of the dinosaurs that roam their homeland, like Feasting Clawfoot and the Fleeting Hastieth.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you learn how to emulate an animal by taking on a specific stance. The flow of energy through your body empowers you and gives you unique insights usually seen only through the eyes of beasts. You learn two stances at 3rd level, choosing from the list below. You learn a third stance at 7th level, and a fourth at 10th level. When you gain a fighter level, you can replace one stance you know with another of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can enter a stance of your choice as a bonus action. You remain in the stance for up to 10 minutes, until you are incapacitated, or until you end the stance early (requiring no action). You can enter your Beast Stance twice, regaining your expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bear Stance.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can push it 5 feet away from you. The first time you make a weapon attack against the creature you push before the end of your next turn, you can roll 1d8 and add it to the damage roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chameleon Stance.</em></strong> When you take the Attack action, you can replace an attack with the Hide action (replacing one of your attacks if you have Extra Attack). You can do so if you are currently being observed, though you are no longer hidden from a creature if you end this turn in its field of vision.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hawk Stance.</em></strong> If you take any fall damage in this stance, subtract 2 x your fighter level from the damage roll (to a minimum of 0 damage). While in this stance, your long and high jump distances are doubled. If you jump 10 feet immediately before making a melee weapon attack, you can roll 1d8 and add it to the weapon’s damage roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Leopard Stance.</em></strong> While in this stance, you gain a climb speed of 20 feet. If you take the Dash or Disengage actions, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action on that turn. On a hit, you can roll 1d8 and add it to the weapon’s damage roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ox Stance.</em></strong> When you make a Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw while in this stance, you can roll 1d6 and add it to the result.

			<p>Nearly every mortal creature on Eberron dreams, their minds traveling to Dal Quor regularly, and scholars of all races have been intrigued by this for millennia. Though the dragons solved most of these mysteries eons ago, the peoples of Sarlona and Khorvaire toil away in their own right. By studying the ruins of Xen’drik and learning from the unique kalashtar, these monks can harness their own connection to Dal Quor, making dreams—and nightmares—into reality.</p>
			<p class="indent">A monk following this tradition is either extremely troubled or extremely untroubled, with few in between. Some constantly daydream, allowing the power of Dal Quor to mingle with their ki. Others train to fight their own nightmares, growing physically stronger to combat mental opponents.</p>

		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Eberron’s history is long, and the long-lived races know this best of all. To lose centuries of experience and knowledge is tragic, even unthinkable. Among the elves of Xen’drik and Aerenal, ancestral worship is taken to an entirely new extreme. The Aereni bring back some that die through strange ritual, powered by the dedication of their descendants’ faith in them, and the Qaltiar elves worship spirits thought to be kept alive by their dedication. And among their descendants, those dedicated to their Forebearers are not uncommon.</p>
			<p class="indent">These holy warriors are connected to the sunlit plane of Irian more than any creatures saving the Undying themselves. The energy they give to those that came before is returned to them tenfold, and with this energy they preserve the ways of the past. This cycle continues across centuries, becoming stronger with each new generation. As such a paladin, you may be the latest and greatest of your line, with dedication to spare.</p>
			<p class="indent">As you embrace the Oath of the Forebearer, you should choose a particular ancestor to follow, often one that is truly legendary. Work with your DM to come up with a set of traits, ideals, and flaws that this ancestor embraces, to guide your character’s particular oath.</p>
			<h5>Tenets of the Forebearer</h5>
			<p>The Oath of the Forebearer is concerned, perhaps obsessed, with the past. It is a religious devotion to the memories of the great beings that gave you life, the giants whose shoulders you ride through life. While the ideals of one’s patron ancestor greatly vary, the core tenets of this oath are universal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Honor Your Ancestors.</em></strong> I will strive to accept, embrace, and fulfill the ideals of those that came before me.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tradition Over Ease.</em></strong> I will not shrug off the duty to my forebearer’s legacy for the sake of modern comforts.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Surpass Your Ancestors.</em></strong> While I remain true to my heritage, I do not ignore opportunities to exceed their deeds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Forge Your Path.</em></strong> When my ancestors have no guidance, I take charge to stay true to their spirit and make it my own.</p>

			<p>The Sulatar drow of Xen’drik follow the Burning Promise. One day, their prophecy says, they will be delivered to a promised utopia of fire, and the world shall end in flame. Their name directly translates as “fire binder,” which is fitting, as they are masters of binding fire elementals to weapons, vehicles, and even themselves. Their rangers will often become Fire Binders proper, covered in burning tattoos and wielding flaming weapons.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Sulatar are not the only place these rangers appear. Devotees of the Silver Flame, especially those remaining in Eldeen, sometimes embrace the flame in this way. Some followers of the Children of Winter ironically embrace the burning embers of Fernia to harken the end of the world. A line of the Tairndal elves that rule Valenar follow a long-standing tradition of fire-wielding, sharing cultural roots with the Sulatar. And in Zilargo, where elemental binding has taken root on Khorvaire, some gnomes wield bound fire to flush out ne’er-do-wells in their nation’s jungles.</p>

			<p>As studiers of the arcane seek out the unknown corners of all that can be known, they inevitably stumble upon the taboo. Hidden truths that should not be known by mortals lay just out of reach, leading some to tap into Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. The horrific revelations they find warp their understanding of the world forever.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wizards following this Arcane Tradition dive everdeeper into forbidden knowledge that can serve as powerful tools and come out the other side forever changed. It is not an easy path to walk by any measure, as it risks the state of one’s body, mind, and very soul. Mordain the Fleshweaver, outcast of House Phiarlan, once walked this path, achieving immortality and infamy at the cost of his morality and livelihood. As a member of the School of Revelation, you may soon follow in his footsteps.</p>
