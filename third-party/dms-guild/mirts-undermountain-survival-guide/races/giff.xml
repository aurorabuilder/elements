			<p>Gun-loving mercenaries from space, the giff are known for their superb martial abilities, their ostentatious uniforms, and their fondness for gunpowder. Giff are usually over 7 feet tall, with a hippopotamus-like head, barrel chest, and tree trunk legs. They range in color from black to gray to rich gold. As a rule, they cover their flesh with a patchwork of tattoos memorializing past missions and victories.</p>
			<h4>Military Minded</h4>
			<p>Giff society is strongly militarist, and combat training begins virtually at birth. Giff are assigned to a regiment from a young age, and usually serve with that regiment throughout their lives. Giff martial prowess means they are highly prized as mercenaries, but they will usually only serve with their own regiment. All giff have a rank, with promotions granted for conspicuous acts of valor.</p>

			<h4>EXPLOSIVES ENTHUSIASTS</h4>
			<p>Although giff are trained in a variety of martial weapons, their true love is for guns and explosives. They relish the flash, noise, and smell of gunpowder. Giff are fond of making bombs and often carry around large quantities of gunpowder for just this purpose. To the giff way of thinking, a locked door is an opportunity for an explosion.</p>
			<h4>ADVENTURING AVERSION</h4>
			<p>It is very unusual for a giff to become an adventurer since doing so requires leaving its comrades-in-arms. A giff without a regiment is considered a deeply shameful affair. A solo giff might be the lone survivor of a terrible battle, some sort of an outlaw, or perhaps the rare individual who rejects their entire social order.</p>
