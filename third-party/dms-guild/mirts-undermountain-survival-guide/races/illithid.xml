		<description>
			<p>Hideous monsters from another dimension, illithids are feared and despised by intelligent creatures across all the known worlds. Also called mind flayers, these psionic masterminds have conquered and enslaved entire worlds for their depraved purposes. In the infinite past, they controlled empires spanning the multiverse. In these latter days they are much reduced, lurking in the Underdark and planning for the day when they will rule again.</p>
			<h4>INSIDIOUS MASTERMINDS</h4>
			<p>Mind flayers are highly intelligent creatures and spend much of their time planning and executing nefarious schemes. Although the means vary enormously, the goal is always the same—the conquest of the "lesser" races. They believe their superior intellect and psionic ability make them the natural masters of all. Illithids typically have creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres in their service.</p>
			<h4>COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS</h4>
			<p>Illithids usually belong to an enclave of siblings called a hive mind. These groups typically range in size from a few dozen to a few hundred, although there have been reports of colonies numbering several thousand. Each enclave is bound to an elder brain, a tentacled, viscous mass floating in a pool of brine, and possessing near god-like intelligence. The elder brain is in constant contact with each member of its enclave telepathically, forming a vast collective intellect.</p>
			<h4>ROGUE AND OUTCAST</h4>
			<p>It is very rare for an illithid to become an adventurer. Doing so requires the creature to break away from the nurture and support of the hive mind, which greatly diminishes its physical and psionic power. A solitary mind flayer might have been abandoned as an infant due to a deformity or mutation. It might have been exiled as an adult due to perverse appetites. Or perhaps it is the sole survivor of an enemy attack on its enclave.</p>
			<h4>ILLITHID NAMES</h4>
			<p>Illithid do not have a gender. Typical names include: Alorxlan, Aurangaul, Conarfen, Crgent, Galuum, Grazilaxx, Grkth, Khamthek, Marsth, Mulseth, Naip, Ralayn, S'venchen, Sempiternal, Shagath, Shuluth, Skwusch, Xameelg, Xetzirbor, Yharaskrik</p>
			<h4>ILLITHID TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Illithid characters have the following traits in common.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Illithids usually live to about 130 years of age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Illithids have a natural inclination toward structure and are almost always lawful. By nature, they are evil, although a mind flayer removed from the influence of the elder brain may well develop a contrary morality.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> On average you are slightly taller than a human. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tentacles.</em></strong> Your tentacles are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal psychic damage equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Charm Resistance.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being magically charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Extract Brain.</em></strong> If you have a humanoid target grappled, as a bonus action you may make an unarmed attack using your tentacles and maw. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage and psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, you kill the target by extracting and devouring its brain. Upon doing this you learn one of the target’s recent memories, as chosen by the DM.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mind Blast.</em></strong> You magically emit psychic energy in a 15-foot cone. When you use your mind blast, each creature in the area of effect must make a Intelligence saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your mind blast, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Undercommon, and Deep Speech. You have telepathy up to 120 feet.</p>
