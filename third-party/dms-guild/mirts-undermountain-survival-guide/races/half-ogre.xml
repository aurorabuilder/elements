		<description>
			<p>Ogres occasionally mate with bugbears, hobgoblins, orcs, or humans. The resulting offspring is known as a half-ogre. Lazy, strong, and bad-tempered, half-ogres are avoided by all people of good sense. A half-ogre with a human parent can occasionally learn enough social graces to live amongst civilized people, but this is rare. More often than not, they either join with ogre gangs or live as isolated loners.</p>
			<h4>IMPETUOUS TEMPER</h4>
			<p>Half-ogres are notoriously bad tempered. Even minor frustrations can lead to sudden and violent outbursts. Half-ogres take great pleasure in smashing things when angry, whether it be a stubborn door, a locked chest, or some poor creature's unfortunate skull. A half-ogre will continue to lash out until its rage is exhausted.</p>
			<h4>IMPENETRABLE STUPIDITY</h4>
			<p>As a rule, half-ogres are exceptionally dense and foolish. Their language skills are rudimentary, and reading is almost unknown amongst them. Although they are great liars, it does not occur to them that others might also tell falsehoods, and so they tend to believe whatever they are told, no matter how fantastic the story. When a half-ogre becomes convinced of something, it is nearly impossible to change its mind.</p>
			<h4>INSATIABLE GREED</h4>
			<p>Half-ogres are legendary for their gluttony and avarice. They tend to take whatever they want, especially if it is in the possession of a weaker creature. They covet anything shiny but have a special lust for gold. They tend to hoard possessions, and their lairs are filled with piles of junk. Half-ogres who become adventurers are most often motivated by greed.</p>
			<h4>HALF-OGRE NAMES</h4>
			<p>Typical names include: Azrach, Drakurg, Drezig, Geerugh, Grruch, Haffa, Mekor, Okurk, Ragnor, Tazok, Truurk, Zuzug</p>		
			<h4>HALF-OGRE TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Half-ogre characters are assumed to have a human parent and an ogre parent. They have the following traits in common.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Half-ogres usually live to about 50 years of age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Half-ogres have a natural inclination toward chaos. They are usually motivated by self-interest and are rarely good.</p>
