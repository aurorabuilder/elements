		<description>
			<p>Nimblewrights are magical constructs created to serve as servants, performers, guards, or assassins. While they are built to serve a master and purpose, nimblewrights have minds of their own and free will. They are built to outlive their creators and thus can find themselves without a master after decades of servitude. Many nimblewrights without a master use their natural skills as acrobatic warriors to wander the world in search of new experiences and discoveries.</p>
			<h4>LITHE CONSTRUCTS</h4>
			<p>Composed predominantly of lightweight wood and powered by magic, nimblewrights can pass for humanoids at a distance while wearing clothing. Nimblewrights tend to favor fashions that suit their intended purpose, so a nimblewright built to entertain might favor flashy clothes, while a nimblewright created to assist a wizard could wear simple robes. Nimblewrights show no emotion, their faces frozen in whatever expression was given to them by their creators.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nimblewrights have no gender. Some are constructed to present as male or female, but the constructs usually do not embrace or understand gender identity.</p>
			<h4>PRACTICAL AND CURIOUS</h4>
			<p>Nimblewrights tend to approach all obstacles with complete practicality. They make swift decisions after contemplating all outcomes then move forward with the most efficient solution. The constructs sometimes act without consulting their companions when they see a course of action that seems to be the obvious correct choice. Most adventuring nimblewrights quickly learn that acting without consulting the rest of the party is not the most courteous way forward (even if it is the most efficient).</p>
			<p class="indent">While nimblewrights come into existence with much of the knowledge needed to perform the tasks their creator chooses for them, they have a natural curiosity about the world. They enjoy learning and tend to embrace new experiences with gusto. This curiosity can sometimes get nimblewrights into trouble, especially if they have no experience outside their creator’s world.</p>
			<h4>DETERMINED MINDS</h4>
			<p>Nimblewrights are constructed with determined minds so that when they are given a goal, they allow nothing to get in their way. Once a nimblewright sets its mind to a task, it can be difficult to dissuade the construct from pursuing it. This is a boon to creators with obedient nimblewrights, but less fortunate creators have kicked out or destroyed constructs so wrapped up in their own goals that they cannot follow orders.</p>
			<h4>NIMBLEWRIGHT NAMES</h4>
			<p>Nimblewrights have names given to them by their creators, usually a name in the maker’s native language. Nimblewrights sometimes choose a second name, called a “purpose name,” which describes a force or goal that drives the construct.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Purpose Names:.</em></strong> Art, Cure, Fashion, Gold, Knowledge, Magic, Mortality, Music, Peace, Power, Secrets, Treasure</p>
			<h4>Nimblewright Traits</h4>
			<p>Your nimblewright character has certain characteristics in common with all other adventuring nimblewrights.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Nimblewrights are typically between 1 and 100 years old and do not deteriorate due to age.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most nimblewrights tend toward neutrality in all matters and value practicality and logic.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Most nimblewrights stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Construct.</em></strong> Your creature type is construct, rather than humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Construct Resilience.</em></strong> Your construct origins give you remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
				<li>You are immune to disease.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to sleep and don’t suffer the effects of exhaustion due to lack of rest, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nimblewright Components.</em></strong> You can install one nimblewright component in your body, which gives you a benefit. You can swap or remove a component during a short or long rest, and you can only power one component at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose three nimblewright components, which you carry and for which you are outfitted, from the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Bright Eyes.</strong> With this component installed, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
				<li><strong>Fleet Feet.</strong> With this component installed, your base walking speed increases 10 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Hidden Compartment.</strong> With this component installed, you have a spring-loaded hidden compartment on your body that can carry and hide one Tiny creature or object inside of you.</li>
				<li><strong>Keen Ears.</strong> With this component installed, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</li>
				<li><strong>Power Lifter.</strong> With this component installed, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</li>
				<li><strong>Voice Box.</strong> With this component installed, you can speak any language you understand (see “Languages” below).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can find the nimblewright components in “Adventuring Gear”.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Repairable.</em></strong> The mending cantrip has the effect of the spare the dying cantrip if it is cast on you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry’s Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you aren’t rendered unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sure-Footed.</em></strong> You are constructed to keep your balance, and have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock you prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can understand, read, and write Common, but you cannot speak without a voicebox (see “Nimblewright Components”).</p>
