		<description>
			<p>With their fey powers and tiny weapons, sprites have anointed themselves protectors of the forest. Their magical empathy allows them to quickly judge friend from foe, and their swift, nimble wings and poison arrows make them formidable adversaries.</p>
			<h4>WOODLAND GUARDIANS</h4>
			<p>Sprites build their villages in the boughs of ancient trees, or hidden in sylvan glades, or secreted on the banks of chattering streams. Sprites train for battle almost from birth. Highly territorial, they vigilantly patrol the local forest for intruders, and anyone despoiling foliage or harassing wildlife is likely to attract their wrath. Sprites are grim and fearless in battle and assail much larger enemies without hesitation.</p>
			<h4>MAGICAL INSIGHT</h4>
			<p>Sprites have a magical empathy that enables them to ascertain the emotional state of other creatures. In some instances, a sprite can even read the surface thoughts of creatures they can see. This enables them to quickly determine who is and isn’t a threat to their forest homes.</p>
			<h4>MASTERS OF POISON</h4>
			<p>Sprites are skillful brewers of toxins and poisons, often using rare plants and fungi to do so. Sprite arrows are coated with a special poison of their own devising, one that renders the target unconscious.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Poison Arrows</h5>
				<p>On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage, or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>SPRITE SIZE THE RIGHT SIZE</h4>
			<p>Most normal equipment is too large for sprites to use, especially weapons and armor. Sprite-sized equipment is about a fifth the weight of regular equipment, and costs 50% more to manufacture. Sprite-sized weapons inflict the next lower damage die than regular weapons. For example, a weapon that normally inflicts 1d6 damage would inflict 1d4 damage if sprite-sized. A weapon that inflicts 1d4 damage inflicts 1 point of damage if sprite-sized. Sprite-sized range weapons have half the normal range.</p>
			<h4>SPRITE NAMES</h4>
			<p>Sprites do not have a gender. They are given a child name by their mater when born, and an adult name by the village chieftain when they turn 11.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Child Names.</em></strong> Ando, Asti, Dee, Esta, Irel, Nyx, Ondo, Rix, Zisk</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Adult Names.</em></strong> Cyrriel, Elsidela, Emberel, Ganriora, Glaxrial, Glinkroëla, Helmiri, Istlewen, Jostor, Minriana, Oriflin, Perinari, Resswena, Tirralas, Trillriela, Weskiel, Wisprior, Zandorondi</p>
			<h4>SPRITE TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Sprite characters have the following traits in common.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Adjustment.</em></strong> Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your Strength score decreases by 4.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Sprite aging is a mysterious affair. Some appear near immortal, while others wither and die after just a few seasons. Sprites themselves say they live “for as long as necessary.”</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most sprites are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> On average you are about 18 inches tall. Your size is Tiny.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 10 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flight.</em></strong> You have a flying speed of 40 feet. While flying, you can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. You cannot fly if you are wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Martial Pedigree.</em></strong> You have trained for war your whole life. You are proficient with the shortbow, rapier, and light armor.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sprite Magic.</em></strong> You can cast the invisibility spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the detect thoughts spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Skilled Poisoner.</em></strong> You have proficiency with the poisoner’s kit. You can spend five downtime days and 25 gp to create 5 poison arrows (see box, “Poison Arrows,” above).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sprite-Sized Equipment.</em></strong> All your starting equipment is sprite-sized. You may substitute one piece of weaponry or armor granted by your class or background for 10 poison arrows.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. You cannot read or write unless your class requires it.</p>
