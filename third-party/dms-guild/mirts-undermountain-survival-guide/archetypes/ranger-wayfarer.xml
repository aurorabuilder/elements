			<p>The Underdark is a dangerous place, and those that venture through the endless night often seek to employ the best. Such wayfarers are masters of helping their charges navigate dangerous passages and interactions with subterranean cultures. Wayfarers are diplomats with a finely honed sense of survival. The best of them learn to share all of these talents with their fellow travelers.</p>
