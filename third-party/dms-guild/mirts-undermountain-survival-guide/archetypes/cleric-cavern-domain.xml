			<p>The endless night of the Underdark hides a multitude of secrets, but those who embrace a life encased in unlit stone gain a connection to the unknown.</p>
			<p class="indent">Clerics with the cavern domain may seek it as a path to protecting miners and others who dwell in the dark. Others choose this path because they identify with the steadiness of stone and the quiet of the cave.</p>
			<p class="indent">Gods whose portfolios include the Cavern domain include: Astilabor, Beltar, Callarduran Smoothhands, Dumathoin, Geb, Ghaunadaur, Gruumsh, Ibrandul, Luthic, Segojan Earthcaller, Shar, Skoraeus Stonebones, and Zotz.</p>
