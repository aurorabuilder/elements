			<p>Few adventurers take traps for granted. For most a trap is a deadly obstacle that stands between them and the conclusion of an epic adventure. For the trapsmith, they are a work of art, a tool to protect their allies, a guardian to discourage pursuit, and so much more.</p>
			<p class="indent">Trapsmiths are masters at setting and disarming traps of all types. The further these rogues progress, the less they have to fear from traps and the better they become at creating them.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to quickly set up simple booby traps by making a Dexterity check using your thieves’ tools. The total of your check becomes both the DC for someone else’s attempt to discover it and the DC to disable the trap. Constructing a trap takes 1 minute. The saving throw for your traps are equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent">Using your thieves’ tools, and 10 gp worth of materials, you can construct one of the traps below. If you spend 1 minute dismantling the trap, you can recover the materials. Other traps may be created at the DM’s discretion, though they may require different costs or time to construct.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you achieve 9th level, you can choose to construct the trap hastily using only an action, but doing so halves the DC to spot the trap and creatures gain advantage to save against your hastily built trap.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alarm Trap.</em></strong> This trap consists of several small bells attached to a thin wire up to 10 feet long that creates a loud noise when tripped or an attached item is moved. It does no damage and the wire is not strong enough to cause a creature to stumble.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Improvement:</em> You can extend the trip wire by 10 feet for every additional 2 gp you spend in materials.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bolt Trap.</em></strong> This trap attaches a tripwire to a concealed crossbow. You must have a hand, light, or heavy crossbow to create this trap in addition to the normal material cost. The crossbow does normal damage for a weapon of its type to victims that fail a Dexterity saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">You may use magical bolts or a magical crossbow when setting your trap or apply poison to the bolts. These additions affect the target as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Improvement:</em> You can set up a trap using up to three crossbows catching the target in a crossfire. Doing so requires three crossbows, costs 2 gp, and adds an additional 2 minutes to construct. At 9th level or higher, if setting this trap hastily, it requires 1 action per crossbow used.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Drop Trap.</em></strong> This trap is made by suspending a heavy or dangerous item and rigging it to fall upon anyone who breaks a trip line. Those who fail a Dexterity saving throw are struck by the item. Traditionally, this is a rock that does bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your proficiency modifier. If you have the item, you may substitute a net, alchemical items, or magical items that activate when broken, such as an elemental gem, a bead from a necklace of fireballs, or a vial of sovereign glue.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Improvement:</em> You can rig up to three individual items, or a very heavy rock that counts as three items (damage equals 3d6 + your proficiency bonus), to fall upon the victim. Doing so costs 1 gp per additional rig and adds 1 additional minute per item. At 9th level or higher, if setting this trap hastily, it requires 1 action per item used.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Trip Rope Trap.</em></strong> This trap is made by stretching a strong rope across two points within 20 feet of each other. Creatures that fail their Dexterity saving throw fall prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Improvement:</em> You can extend the rope by 10 feet for every additional 1 gp you spend in materials. You can also embed barbs in the rope that do piercing damage equal to 1d3 + your proficiency bonus for an additional 1 gp.</p>
