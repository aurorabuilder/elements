			<p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Stone have a special connection with the very bones of the world and commune with the elemental spirits that inhabit mountains, hills, caves, and tunnels. These druids resist change and seek to preserve things as they are. Filled with the strength of stone, these implacable defenders of nature are equally at home above and below the ground.</p>
