			<p>When you choose this pact at 1st level, you drain the power of your fallen enemies to surround yourself with an aura of deadly darkness. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you encase yourself with swirling shadows that give you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Your darkspiral aura ends when you take a short rest, long rest, or you choose to expend it.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a hostile creature that you can see targets you with a melee or ranged attack, you can expend your darkspiral aura as a reaction to deal psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma bonus + your proficiency bonus. If you also choose to damage an ally in addition to a hostile target, you add your warlock level to the damage. The ally must take damage to gain this bonus.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can whisper dark promises to an enemy within 60 feet, causing them to believe their enemies are friends and their friends are now enemies. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). While charmed, the target regards allies as hated enemies until the spell ends and makes every effort to kill them in the most effective way available to it. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">When using this feature, you can curse an ally to make all of their attacks, saving throws, and ability checks with disadvantage for the duration, and the target can then make its first attack each round with advantage.</p>
