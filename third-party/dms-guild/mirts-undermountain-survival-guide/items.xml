			<p>An ordinary rope may be turned into a lasso.</p>
			<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a lasso is Restrained until it is freed. A lasso has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. Treat a completely stationary target as having AC 10.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature caught by a lasso can use its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 3 slashing damage to the lasso (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and turning the lasso into a cut rope.</p>
