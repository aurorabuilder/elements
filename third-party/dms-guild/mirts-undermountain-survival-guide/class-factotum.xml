		<description>
			<p>When heading into the depths of Undermountain, sometimes the party finds itself short a few members. During key moments in a fight the cleric goes down, when a trap is discovered the rogue is nowhere to be found, or someone just needs to hold the door. When someone needs to fill in, look to the factotum!</p>
			<h4>FLEXIBLE LEARNER</h4>
			<p>The factotum has spent a lifetime studying famous adventurers and picking up a few of their skills. A factotum is accomplished in just about every trade a dungeoneering party might need, with enough lore to fake what they haven’t learned yet, at least for a brief time. Flexible and full of tricks, the factotum always has a solution.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even a jack of all trades like the factotum specializes somewhat. While all factotums can swing a sword and cast a spell, some focus their efforts studying the great warriors of yore, while others delve into secrets of forgotten spellcasters.</p>
			<h4>CHARLATAN AND DILETTANTE</h4>
			<p>The factotum uses their intelligence and guile to overcome obstacles. They are the consummate dabbler who relies on their ingenuity, but even their tricks run out. Their reliance on secondhand stories and self-taught experience makes it difficult for them to go the distance like other specialists might. Much like a wizard, resting factotums return to their books searching for lore that will help them meet the next day’s challenge—or at least find one more gimmick to get out alive.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A FACTOTUM</h4>
			<p>When creating your factotum, consider what motivates you. Are you seeking to master all knowledge and be the epitome of humanoid development, or are you a charlatan who knows just enough to fake any adventuring role until you strike it rich?</p>
			<p class="indent">Also consider where you picked up your diverse collection of skills. Did you learn them from other adventurers? Have you studied in a great library? What type of stories and lore most appeal to you?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a factotum quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the fire bolt cantrip.</p>
			<h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
			<p>As a factotum, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per factotum level</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per factotum level after 1st</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, shields</li>
				<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons</li>
				<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Thieves’ tools</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence</li>
				<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any three</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>(a) a shortbow and 20 arrows or (b) a mace</li>
				<li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
				<li>(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack</li>
				<li>Studded leather armor, thieves’ tools, two daggers and a book of stories</li>

			<p>At 20th level, you have read the darkest tomes and made questionable deals with otherworldly powers to pose as a powerful user of magic. By spending 5 ingenuity points as a bonus action, you can duplicate one of these class features for one minute. You can only have one of these features active at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Eldritch Invocation.</em></strong> You whisper a deal to some fell creature that you have no intention of honoring and they foolishly grant you forbidden power. You activate one warlock invocation that has no prerequisites.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Metamagic.</em></strong> You force your own creativity into one of your spells. Each round for the duration you may apply one of the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Careful Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 ingenuity point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</li>
				<li><strong>Distant Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 ingenuity point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 ingenuity point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Subtle Spell.</strong> When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 ingenuity point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Wild Shape.</em></strong> You magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before with a CR of 1 or lower. At the end of the duration you revert to your normal form unless you use this feature again and expend another 5 ingenuity points. You revert to your normal form after 1 minute or by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>
				<li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
				<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
				<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source, and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
				<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
