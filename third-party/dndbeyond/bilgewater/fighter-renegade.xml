    <description>
      <p>What defines a Renegade is not simply the weapon they wield, or the ways they fight. A renegade, above all else, is a fighter of sly charm and swagger. With brash cockiness in spades, renegades build their own custom firearms to perfectly suit their own larger-than-life personalities. Particularly well-funded renegades may even have personalized Hextech weapons, but such folk are rare among the scoundrels of Bilgewater.</p>
      <p>Don’t mistake their boasting for an empty facade—folk who underestimate a renegade’s flashy gunplay tend to wind up dead.</p>
