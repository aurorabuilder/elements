            <p>Some rogues favor honing their skill and precision, others perfect a silver tongue, but you—well, you’ve always gotten a kick out of leaving things up to chance.</p>
            <p>Rogues of the Wild Card variety thrive on the high stakes and random thrill of the game table. Armed with cunning cheats and no small amount of luck, these sly gamblers live and die by their rules, never keen to simply accept the hand fate deals them.</p>

            <p>Starting at 9th level, you are acutely aware of how to quit when you’re ahead, vanishing in a flash when the odds begin to turn against you. As a bonus action, you can disappear with a dramatic flourish.

			<p>You have developed a fighting style based around the cartomancy of the Serpent Isles. You have your own deck of enchanted cards, and can make their edges razor-sharp with a flick of your wrist. If you have not yet used your Sneak Attack this turn, you can use your action to take one of these cards and attack a creature within 30 feet with it. The attack roll for this feature uses your Dexterity modifier, and on a hit, it deals slashing damage equal 1d4 + your Dexterity modifier. When you roll for damage, look at the number rolled on the d4. The attack gains a random effect based on the number rolled, as detailed in the Wild Card Suit table below.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can attack using a card in this manner a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses after a long rest.</p>
