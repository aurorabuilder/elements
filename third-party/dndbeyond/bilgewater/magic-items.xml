        <description>
            <p>This metal helmet is set with crystals that change color when exposed to elemental energy. While wearing this helm, if you are the target of an attack which would deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage you can use a reaction to adapt to that damage type. While adapted, you have resistance to that damage type. The helm returns to its normal state after ten minutes. </p>

        <description>
            <p>This amulet is shaped like a sword with a small ruby set in the crossguard. Once per day when you are the target of a spell you can use a reaction to cast counterspell (using your spellcasting ability). Casting counterspell in this way does not expend a spell slot.</p>

        <description>
            <p>The jagged shards of this blade are bound together by sickly green energy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, the humanoid takes an extra 3d6 damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are attuned to the sword, once a day at midnight, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw unless you are undead. On a failed save, your maximum hit points are reduced by 10. Hit points lost in this way can only be restored by a wish spell. If your maximum hit points are reduced to 0 in this way, you die and immediately rise as a wraith.</p>

        <description>
            <p>These fashionable boots are adorned with small white wings. While you wear these boots your base walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be restrained.</p>

The shoved creature takes 1d8 piercing damage, in addition to either being knocked prone or pushed.</p>

    <element name="Powder Keg" type="Magic Item" source="Legends of Runeterra: Dark Tides of Bilgewater" id="ID_BEYOND_LRDTOB_MAGIC_ITEM_POWDER_KEG">
        <description>
            <p>These small wooden barrels are filled with highly volatile gun powder, then magically sealed for easy transport. Setting fire to a keg requires one action and a lit torch, match, or similar magical effect. Once set on fire, a powder keg explodes at the end of the round it is lit, dealing 1d10 fire damage to creatures and objects within 10 feet of it. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.</p>
