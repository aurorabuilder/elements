		<description>
			<p>Welcome to Bilgewater, the most remarkable port in the world of Runeterra! D&amp;D Beyond is thrilled to bring this renowned city to life, giving you the tools to create your own Legends of Runeterra-inspired Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.</p>
			<p>This is a world of champions and monsters, of nations rising and falling in wars of conquest and magic. The many lands of Runeterra are bursting with adventures of all kinds, from gritty street-level brawls to epic battles between supernatural powers, and Bilgewater is no exception. Packed to the gills with smugglers, scofflaws, and scoundrels, Bilgewater is more than a common pirate haven, though it has more than its fair share of pirates, too!</p>
