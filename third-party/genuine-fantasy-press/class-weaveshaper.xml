		<description>
			<p><em>An elf chants in an ancient library, listening to the whispers of the story stones around her. Ribbons of arcane energy form around her blades each time she cuts at the air, gathering her power in practice for what must be done.</em></p>
			<p><em>A human man clad in red and black faces a massive golem of cloth and necromantic magic. He summons a strange sword to his hands while calling to the arcane eye bound upon his magical outfit. In a flash of light the outfit transforms into a suit of fantastical armor covered in blades. With incredible speed, he launches forward and lashes out at the nightmare with a barrage of attacks, cutting and cleaving.</em></p>
			<p><em>A dwarf gestures, weaving a massive bladed mace from arcane thread as massive mechanical armor grows around her. The oncoming orcish horde heistates for just a moment, and that’s all the time she needs to break them.</em></p>
			<p><em>A tiefling cloaked in darkness spins a web of shadowy string between his hands. As a tavern brawl begins, he stands and demands that the violent patrons take their fight elsewhere, coiling tentacles of dark shadowsilk writhing in the air around him. Frightened, the combatants quickly flee, never seeing the tiefling’s bladed cloak twitch ominously.</em></p>
			<p>These are weaveshapers: warriors who pursue magical and martial perfection by creating powerful weapons called threadblades. By infusing their bodies with countless fragments of arcane energy from every school of magic, they strive for perfection through cunning artifice and martial study rather than introspective meditation or exploration of the more traditional arcane arts.</p>
			<h4>WOVEN BLADES</h4>
			<p>There is a certain power in harmony and unity between the arcane disciplines. Weaveshapers seek to harness this unity and instill within themselves the same eerie perfection. Thus, they train their bodies and minds to work in unison, learning to weave threads of arcane energy comprised of the many different strands of arcana.</p>
			<p class="indent">The first act that defines the weaveshaper is the creation of a threadblade. By memorizing the complex gestures and mental states required to invoke arcane thread, the weaveshaper can create powerful weapons with strange and majestic forms. These weapons are known as threadblades, as they appear to be woven from strings of magic. The sharpened edges and eerie blades of these wicked tools are crafted by conjuring thin panes of raw force around compressed arcane thread, leading to colorful and powerful expressions of each weaveshaper’s personal style.</p>
			<h4>SKIN AND SKEIN</h4>
			<p>Once a weaveshaper masters the creation of their threadblade, the next step is the creation of an arcane infusion. By weaving arcane energy into their clothing and bodies, these magical warriors begin to ascend to a higher physical and mental state. The most common manifestation of this power is a set of remarkable garb, which layers over the weaveshaper, providing strength and durability through magical enhancement. Unlike monks, who harness the natural power of ki within themselves, weaveshapers rely on arcane mastery and knowledge to empower their bodies to the peak of perfection.</p>
			<h4>PERSONAL TAPESTRIES</h4>
			<p>Each weaveshaper has a unique taste and style, as all creative artists do, and so they learn to create mystical accessories to compliment their infusions and threadblades. These can manifest in a variety of ways, from sentient eyes of woven cloth or cloaks of living blades to massive mechanical armor and illusory tomes of arcana. The threadblade may be a masterwork that binds them, and infusion is an art often discussed, but conversation regarding these personal implements is rare by custom.</p>
			<h4>UNIFIED PATTERNS</h4>
			<p>Despite the varying threadblades, infusions, and tapestries of the weaveshapers, the methods for unleashing arcane might during combat is rigid, structured, and subject to much scholarly discussion. The arcane essence of a threadblade naturally aligns to a peculiar set of attacks, one following another to weave a resulting rush of magical energies. Some patterns empower the body of the weaveshaper, allowing one to strike with swiftness and surety, while others unleash elemental forces or conjure other weapons. Many weaveshapers say their study is merely scholastic, but the results in battle are unquestionable and undeniable.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A WEAVESHAPER</h4>
			<p>When creating a weaveshaper, consider how you came to adopt this rare skill. Most weaveshapers train under tutors, learn in academies dedicated to the arcane arts, or are taught by entities bound to them due to the strange loom of fate. Why did you choose to continue down this path instead of learning traditional magic, for which you obviously have the aptitude? Is it due to restrictions placed upon you by your culture or your family? Is it by personal choice, seeing the mundane arcane arts as beneath you, or beyond your grasp? Do you endeavor to study both, and have merely started your journey here? Regardless, the path you’ve chosen is one that must be tread with careful consideration.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a weaveshaper quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence, since it is essential when using your pattern attacks and when casting the spells you gain later. Then, select the Scissorblade. Finally, choose a background that would present you with an opportunity to study the arcane arts.</p>

			<p>At 2nd level, you learn to perform Weave Finishers: deadly finishing moves fueled by your arcane power. Each time you make an attack with your threadblade or an accessory weapon granted by this class, you spin a fraction of that attack’s power into an arcane string, which hovers around your threadblade as a ribbon of light. Your collected arcane strings disappear after 1 minute and when you roll initiative.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can perform a Weave Finisher by spending the listed number of arcane strings stated in each Finisher’s description by using your bonus action when you take the Attack action during your turn. Your Weave Tier represents the power of your Weave Finishers, and is listed in the Weaveshaper table.</p>
			<h5>Learning Weave Finishers</h5>
			<p>At 2nd level, you learn four Weave Finishers: Restitch, and three of your choosing from the Weave Finisher list at the end of this class description.</p>
			<p class="indent">You learn two new Weave Finishers at 6th, 9th, and 15th level. You can exchange one of your Weave Finishers for a new one for which you meet the prerequisites when you gain a level in this class. You can’t exchange Restitch for another Weave Finisher.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your weaveshaper spells and Weave Finishers, since your control over magic comes from careful study and practice. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell or Weave Finisher refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a weaveshaper spell you cast, when a weaveshaper feature you use requires the target make a saving throw, and when making a spell attack roll from casting a weaveshaper spell or using a weaveshaper feature.</p>

You aren’t entirely sure if it obeys your conscious thoughts or your subconscious mind, but either way, it is always watching your back. Raise your hood, or raise your blades.</p>
