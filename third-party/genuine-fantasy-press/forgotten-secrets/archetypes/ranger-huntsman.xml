			<p>In your life, you’ve slain a creature great and terrible, whether by design or by the twisting turns of fate, showing the mastery of mortals over the natural world. As you brought the beast low, you felt the eyes of an ancient immortal upon you. The sheer power of the Wild Huntsman’s cold intent tore the beast open and infused you with its spirit. You owe no favor to this manifestation of the predatory nature of mankind, nor must you hold it in any esteem. Nevertheless, the cursed cold of its domain flows through your veins, even as the twisted spirit of the beast you slew writhes within your skin, bursting forth in a spiritual manifestation of primal hate. In the heat of combat, you must keep an icy grip on your humanity, lest you fall to the dark hunger of the predator. It is through dominance that you shall triumph, for anything less will lead to your death. Prove to the Huntsman that you are greater than a beast. Prove to yourself that you are worthy of life and power. You are a Hound of the Huntsman, and your curse shall be your salvation.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, the spirit of the beast you slew begins to awaken within you, gradually seeking to drive you to the ravenous urges of a wild animal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you take the Attack action, you can choose to make feral attacks in place of your normal attacks if you have at least one free hand. Strength is your ability score for a feral attack. When you do this, the spiritual claws of the beast within manifest around your arm as you strike a creature within your reach. Make an attack roll. If you hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier. You can choose to use your bonus action to make an additional feral attack if at least one feral attack you’ve made during your turn hits a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you kill a creature with a feral attack, you risk losing control of yourself and are overwhelmed with a compulsion to feast on the creature’s spirit. If the corpse of a creature you have slain with a feral attack is within your reach at the start of your turn during the first minute after you have killed it, your predatory spirit will appear and feast using your action, granting you temporary hit points equal to half your ranger level + your Constitution modifier. Once it does this, you regain control, and you can use a bonus action before the end of your turn to make one feral attack.</p>

			<p>Also at 3rd level, the hoarfrost of the Huntsman’s domain infuses your mind and body even as your soul fights within you. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Dark Hunter.</strong> You ignore disadvantage on Perception checks caused by dim lighting.</li>
				<li><strong>Flawless Pursuit.</strong> Whenever a hostile creature you can see takes the Dash action, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed towards them, even while mounted.</li>
				<li><strong>Hunting Blind.</strong> You can create an area of artificial camouflage up to 10 feet in each dimension for yourself and your allies over the course of 1 minute. While within, you gain advantage on Stealth checks and cannot be detected by scent.</li>
				<li><strong>Winter’s Might.</strong> You can add your Strength modifier to your AC in place of your Dexterity modifier, and you can use your Strength modifier when making attacks with ranged weapons. This does not allow you to surpass the normal limits of an armor’s AC value.</li>

			<p>At 7th level, your savagery becomes even more difficult to contain, but you begin to embrace the eldritch power of this primal spirit. Whenever you make an additional feral attack using your bonus action, you can choose to dominate the beast within by giving it the blood it craves. If this attack hits, it inflicts the maximum possible damage per die, and if this is a killing blow, you are not forced to use your action to feast upon the soul of the creature if you start your turn while the corpse is within your reach, though you may choose to do so using your action as normal. If the attack misses, you have disadvantage on all attacks targeting a creature other than the one you just attacked until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, your jumping height and distance increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength score.</p>

If you hit that target during your next turn, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your ranger spell save DC.

			<p>At 15th level, you learn to bind the spirit within you more fully, forcing it to obey your whims and mastering the predatory instinct within you. You can now always make an additional feral attack using your bonus action, even if you haven’t taken the Attack action, and you can feast upon the spirit of a corpse as a bonus action instead of an action. Finally, you can track by scent, and gain advantage on all Perception checks.</p>
