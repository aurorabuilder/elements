			<p>Wandering between worlds, a massive fortress known as the Eternal Citadel collects forlorn travelers, hermits, and sole survivors to work in its service. Trapping these lost souls within its walls until they agree to follow the strange instincts brought on by the emotions and feelings the Citadel silently sends, this mysterious bastion works to preserve and protect all things, destroying only that which would bring ruin and desolation to the world. You are one of the few who have wandered inside at some point in your life, seeking shelter or knowledge, and now the influence of this place becomes clearly felt, granting you power and longevity to fight the forces of destruction for all eternity.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, your body begins to gradually become more refined, made perfect and whole in preparation for your work. Any physical deformities that you may have are fixed and your body is made whole again. Lost limbs reform, blemishes vanish, and your visage becomes timeless and clean. You gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks. If you take no damage for seven consecutive days, this process of purification and renewal occurs again at sunset.</p>

			<p>Also at 3rd level, your defensive prowess allows you to halt the progress of your foes. Hostile creatures cannot move through your space. If a hostile creature is within 10 feet of you, the weight of countless ages bears down upon them. If they attempt to move to another space that is further than 10 feet from you, they must first make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. If they fail, they lose the ability to move farther away from you for the remainder of their turn unless they inflict damage upon you after failing their saving throw.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, your transformation continues as you become further attuned to the Citadel. You no longer need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. In order to gain the benefits of a short or long rest, you must still spend the downtime performing only light activity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your eyes see the small cracks and wear upon everything around you, allowing you to mark the passage of time with perfect accuracy. You can unerringly identify the true age of any person or object that you can clearly see, and you can choose to know the time that the person will die of old age based on their current health, diet, and lifespan, down to the day.</p>
