			<p>Somewhere in your lineage, an ancestor entered and made a pact with the Blackthorn Grove, replacing their heart with one crafted from the essence of the Grove itself. Working with plants has always come naturally to you, but one day your magical power awakened. In defense of your life or in pursuit of your heart’s deepest desires, the strange arcana of the Blackthorn Grove sprouted within your veins, giving you power to use as you see fit.</p>
			<p class="indent">Let your power burn forth like wildfire.</p>

			<p>When you select this origin at 1st level, your spirit aligns to the power of the Grove, calling to the cycles of regrowth. You learn the druidcraft cantrip. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. </p>

			<p>Also at 1st level, whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Roll 1d10 for each level of the spell slot you expended. If the total is equal to or greater than the creature’s remaining hit point total, it falls asleep as though affected by the sleep spell.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, your connection to the Grove imbues you with a thirst for blood and the power to claim it. When you cast a spell on the druid spell list that deals damage by expending a spell slot, you can spend sorcery points equal to half the spell’s level to gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt to one creature damaged by the spell.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, you attune yourself to the Maze of Blood. You ignore difficult terrain. You can ignore magical and nonmagical effects that would cause plants to hinder or damage you, such as from the effect of the entangle spell. Whenever you use your Sleeper in the Field feature and the target’s hit points are greater than the number rolled, you can use your bonus action to deal magical piercing damage equal to half the number rolled to the target.</p>
