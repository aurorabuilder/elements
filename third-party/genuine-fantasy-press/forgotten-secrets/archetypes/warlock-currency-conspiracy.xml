			<p>Hushed whispers fill your mind, informing you that your memories are your own. You don’t quite understand what that means, but it seems that the Cabal may have a grand plan that requires your action and needs you to be aware of the reality behind your deeds. Perhaps you were knowledgeable and unscrupulous, willing to bargain away the life of another, or perhaps more powerful entities, intervened on your behalf and restored your memory. Nevertheless, now you know the truth behind the Currency Conspiracy. Along with this knowledge comes the ability to manifest the unusual power of Gilt and to wield a measure of control over the karensee. Will you use it to further the dark goals of the Conspiracy, or will you bite the hand that feeds and turn against the dark masterminds of the Cabal?</p>
			<p class="indent">The choice is yours, but the price must be paid in blood.</p>

			<p>When you choose this patron at 1st level, you gain a single coin that acts as a manifestation of your soul, known as a Gilded Coin. You can summon the coin to your hand or dismiss this coin as a bonus action regardless of its location. Other creatures see this coin as 1 gp or other appropriate currency of equivalent value. You are always aware of who is in possession of your Gilded Coin.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can choose to convert all currency you have in your possession into an equivalent value in any other denomination or currency. For example, you can convert gold coins into an equivalent value of silver or copper pieces, or change them into other currencies you’ve seen before. Additionally, you can choose to conceal currency you possess in a pocket dimension, which you can access using a bonus action. If you die, the currency reappears on your corpse.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, whenever you reduce a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points using a cantrip or a spell cast using a warlock spell slot or when a creature swears a binding oath of loyalty to you, you can choose to capture a fraction of their soul, granting you an amount of Gilt equal to the creature’s hit point maximum. Once you’ve acquired Gilt from a creature, you can’t acquire more from that creature until their Gilt has been spent in full. Whenever you cast a spell using a warlock spell slot that has a material component worth more than 1 gp, you can choose to pay an equal amount of Gilt in place of the material components. The material components appear and exist for the duration of the spell if not consumed by the spell.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can choose to spend an amount of Gilt equal to your warlock level as a bonus action to conceal your movements for 1 hour. When you take the Hide action, you become invisible and inaudible to creatures until the start of your next turn so long as they are more than 10 feet away from you. This can allow you to Hide even when you lack cover or concealment. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>At 10th level, your connection to wealth allows you to manipulate events in your favor in subtle yet surprising ways. Whenever a creature is touching your Gilded Coin, you gain a measure of control over them. As a bonus action while you can see this creature, you can manipulate them in a subtle way that can’t be detected. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, the target uses its reaction to move up to its speed then takes the Use an Object action, performing an activity of your choice. The action can’t cause direct harm to them or anyone that they are aware of, but can have unforeseen consequences. Once you target a creature with this feature, you can’t target them again for the next 24 hours.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your connection to the Conspiracy enables you to erase the memories of others at a whim. As an action, choose any number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you, and expend an amount of Gilt less than or equal to three times your warlock level. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or have their memories erased, forgetting about actions you’ve taken and events that directly involved you for the previous number of minutes equal to the amount of Gilt spent. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
