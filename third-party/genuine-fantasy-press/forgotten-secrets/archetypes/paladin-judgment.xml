		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You have sworn to balance the cosmic scales of the universe, following in the footsteps of the Warrior-Saint, an immortal justiciar who fights to maintain order and balance between the infinite planes. Those who take this oath are forever bound to fight and slay creatures that go against the order of the cosmos, such as fiends that would seek to destroy the heavens, or angels that hunger to purify the hells. Otherworldly entities such as the ever-conflicting Alrisen often attract the attentions of these justiciars, who work to support the losing side so that the world will not be destroyed by their conflict, and so all mortal individuals will retain the right to choose instead of being forced to obey the unconscious desires of greater beings. If a conflict arises that cannot be contained by words alone, it is your task to decide the outcome. You are the judge and the executioner, and the world is your courtroom. All shall rise in your honor, and all shall fall by your hand.</p>
			<h5>Tenets of Judgment</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Judgment are commonly witnessed by a scribeant swarm, which records the event in perfect clarity for review by the Warrior-Saint itself. This oath holds the following four ideals above all others:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Know the Truth:</em></strong> Always seek a full understanding of the reality of the situation, and let no illusions stand before your impartial gaze.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroy the Guilty:</em></strong> Order must be maintained and enforced without exception. There will always be another villain to replace this one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Maintain the Balance:</em></strong> Angels and demons, fey and nightmares from beyond the planes, all must heed the order of the cosmos. Defiance is death.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Harmonize the Scales:</em></strong> Sometimes, there is no enemy before you. Work to undo the damage done by the accused.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>As Above.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to call down cosmic fire from the higher planes to burn away a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. If it fails, it takes radiant damage equal to 10 + your paladin level and become immersed in an ethereal light, preventing it from taking the Hide action or being invisible for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>So Below.</em></strong> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to summon the corrupted vigor of the lower planes to lend power to your voice. Each fey, celestial, and aberration within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you or take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You gain resistance to all damage.</li>
				<li>Damage you deal ignores resistance and immunity.</li>
				<li>If you would be affected by a spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can use your reaction to cast that same spell without expending a spell slot.</li>
