			<p>You’ve made a pact with an ancient power known as the Storm Lord. Massive and timeless, this godlike entity sails the winds of the void through the darkest places between the skies of countless worlds. It is the spirit that consumes the purified souls of heroes as it welcomes them into its kingdom. Its long tendrils of lightning cover the sky, heralding the violent tempest that follows. This entity finds silent amusement at seeing mortals in peril, and it tends to draw cults of shadowy beings to worship at its altars, performing dark rituals in the name of the Lord of Winds. You have stood before the Storm Lord, unbowed and unbroken, to make a pact that will shake the very fabric of reality. Sparks will leap from your fingertips and fog will rise from your breath as you strike down your enemies with the devastating and majestic power of the Master of the Unfallen Kingdom.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to manifest a fraction of the awe-inspiring glory of the Storm Lord. As an action, choose any number of creatures in a 15-foot radius of you. The targets must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they fall prone and remain prone on their next turn unless they use all of their movement to stand.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, you discover the unspoken secrets of the heroes who sought the downfall of the Storm Lord. As an action, you cleave the air with a blade of purest wind in a line 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. A creature takes force damage equal to three times your warlock level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Unattended objects automatically fail this saving throw.</p>
