		<description>
			<p>Somewhere in your bloodline, one of your ancestors made a pact with a powerful spirit of flame and predation known as the Ashen Wolf. This elemental creature is neither fiend nor fey, but something primal and otherworldly. It is honored with ritualistic immolation and sacrifices of meat and metal. While the Wolf may have no hold over you, it may be interested in your affairs nevertheless, and your very existence could draw the ire of the Wolfâ€™s eternal foe: the frost-bound Wild Huntsman. With smoke and cinders pouring from your hands with each spell you cast and a layer of ash gradually creeping over your body, you are the incarnation of a smoldering ember thrown upon a dry forest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Let your power burn forth like wildfire.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, a thin layer of ash and charred wood begins to coat your skin as you fight, engulfing you, yet allowing you to blaze back to life with a vengeance. Whenever you are below your hit point maximum, charred claws and fangs erupt from your hands and mouth. While you have these claws, you can use your bonus action to make a melee spell attack that deals fire damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, the damage increases to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier. </p>
			<p class="indent">The first time after a long rest when you are below half your hit point maximum, the ash that coats your body infuses your soul, granting you gain resistance to fire damage. This lasts until you finish a long rest. At 14th level, you gain immunity instead of resistance.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can speak, read, and write Primordial, the language of elementals, and you learn the produce flame cantrip.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, the fire within you begins to call directly to the Ashen Wolf, and it grants you strength, either in honor of your ancestor or in a twisted form of revenge. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack granted by your Born of Ember class feature, the burning fury empowering your attack surges through the creature, turning its vital organs to ash and granting you temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier. Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point during your turn when you are below half your hit point maximum to cause the ash upon your skin to harden. Until the start of your next turn, your AC is 17. This has no effect if your AC is equal to or greater than 17.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your spark has grown to a flame, burning black with dark power. Any time you would inflict fire damage, you can choose to inflict necrotic damage instead, and vice versa. Additionally, your ashen form allows you to move with unnatural ease, disintegrating and reforming with each step you take. You ignore difficult terrain, and you can move through any space at least 6 inches wide without squeezing. </p>

		<description>
			<p>At 18th level, your strength has grown to surpass that of your ancestor, and your power over the ancient and primal magics of flame and ash is without peer. </p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to launch yourself skyward in a pillar of fire and smoke before crashing down at a location that you can see within 60 feet of your point of origin, unleashing a hellish blast of fire and cursed power at a creature within 5 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. The target takes 6d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target is slain by this attack, it is consumed instantly by flame, and the ashes coalesce into a hell hound. Hell hounds summoned by this feature are elementals instead of fiends. The hell hound obeys your orders without question and acts during your turn. You canâ€™t have more than two hell hounds at a time from this feature. Creation of a third hell hound destroys the oldest one still alive. Each hell hound remains in your service until slain or until the third dawn after it was summoned, at which point it disintegrates into ash.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest. </p>

			<description>As an action you can spend 5 sorcery points to launch yourself to a location within 60 feet of you dealing 6d10 fire damage to all enemies that fail a dexterity saving throw (DC {{spellcasting:dc:cha}}) 5 feet from the point of origin. If an enemy is killed from this feature, you spawn one hell hound for each enemy killed, up to a max of 2. These hell hounds are elementals and attack on your turn, disintegrating after 3 days.</description>
