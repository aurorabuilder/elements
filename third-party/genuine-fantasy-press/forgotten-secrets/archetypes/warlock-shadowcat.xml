			<p>Your patron is an otherworldly incarnation of fate that strides between planes; a living omen of ill luck and good fortune alike. Drawn to the dreams of mortals, its lesser reflections perch upon the chests of the unwary in their sleep, stealing breath and fragments of life from their victims as they feed upon the nightmares this brings. When they’ve had their fill, they return to their master, who sends them back again to hunt down the creatures that have escaped from the nightmares of those tormented by darker fates. You’ve drawn the attention of this creature, for good or ill, and have made your pact in the deepest shadows of the dark. Now, shadows boil around your hands, both inky black and snow white, tainted and blessed by the touch of the Inverse. You’ve been there, seen the sun of endless emptiness and the void of pure light that shines from beyond the stars, and you have felt the gaze of the nightmares that stare upon you with jealousy, feeling their hate. They know that while you can depart unharmed, their nights are numbered. You’ve stolen their luck, and now you’ll use that power for your own ends.</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, your patron’s magic allows you to be everywhere and nowhere at once. As an action, you can fade partway into the Inverse, gaining advantage on Stealth checks for 1 hour. When you roll initiative while in this state, you can choose to teleport up to 60 feet to a location within 10 feet of a creature you can see. If you deal damage to the creature with an attack during the first round of combat, you can use your bonus action to steal their breath and spirit. The target takes psychic damage equal to your warlock level and cannot speak or make sound until the start of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can curse an enemy that you can see within 60 feet of you with terrible misfortune as a bonus action. Whenever the target makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 after seeing the result. If the result is a 6, the result of their d20 roll is replaced with a 1. This curse lasts for one minute, and ends early if either you or the target are reduced to 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, the Shadowcat’s hunger for nightmares grants you the power to create them. You can no longer be surprised. Your Dream Stalker feature no longer has a limit to the number of times it can be used. Whenever you use your Dream Stalker feature’s bonus action, all hostile creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
