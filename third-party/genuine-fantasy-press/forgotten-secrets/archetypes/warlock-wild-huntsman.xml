			<p>You’ve made a pact with the Wild Huntsman, a dark incarnation of the predatory nature of man. Cursed with a bitter chill that can only be shaken by the blood of the prey and riding astride a steed whose eyes are cold as ice, the Wild Huntsman journeys between the planes seeking the greatest of challenges and the weakest of souls to harvest for its collection. You’ve encountered this entity and survived where others have fallen before its spear, and in return, your life has been spared and your bargain made. You’ve been granted a place at the Huntsman’s table and the services of its tireless steeds and hunting hounds, who howl in the darkest winter nights while seeking living souls to claim</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, you can call on your connection to the cold winds of the blizzard to carry you to your prey and close off their escape. As a bonus action, you can move up to 30 feet toward a hostile creature you can see. If you’re mounted, your mount can move instead of you. If you make an attack roll targeting the creature before the end of this turn, polished ice forms in a 5-foot radius centred underneath the creature, creating difficult terrain that lasts until the start of your next turn. You ignore difficult terrain created by this effect.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you learn to summon a loyal steed from the Huntsman’s stable. You can cast find steed without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, its casting time is one action, and you can choose to have the steed appear underneath you, moving you instantly to the saddle. While you are mounted on the summoned steed, you can choose to take any damage that would be dealt to the steed. When summoned, your steed appears with hit points equal to the amount it had when you dismissed it. While summoned, your steed recovers all lost hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. If your steed has been reduced to 0 hit points, it can’t be summoned again using this feature until you finish a long rest. At 14th level, you can resummon a fallen steed after a short or long rest.</p>

While mounted you can take any damage that the steed takes, instead of it. When summoned the steed has the same hit points from when it was dismissed. It regains all its hit points when you take a short or long rest with it summoned. Once killed it cannot be summoned again in this manner until you finish a long rest.</description>

			<p>Starting at 10th level, you gain resistance to cold damage and are not subject to exhaustion gained from cold environments or high altitudes. You also learn to call the Huntsman’s favored servants. As an action, you can summon a pack of the Huntsman’s hounds to an empty space within 30 feet of you. The hounds use the stat block provided with this subclass. The pack understands your commands and obeys you without hesitation, acting on your initiative. Its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your warlock level. When your pack is reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes into frozen mist and can’t be resummoned until you finish a long rest. You can dismiss your pack at any time as an action.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 14th level, the cold winds of the boreal forests come at your call. You, your steed, and your hounds ignore difficult terrain while in cold regions, and your hounds and steed also gain resistance to cold damage. While you are in a cold region, you and creatures you control emit a magical aura that creates icy difficult terrain in a 10-foot radius.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose to perform a ritual that will gradually change the climate in a 10-mile radius to a cold and snowbound region harried by a blizzard for 24 hours. The ritual must be performed once in mountainous or cold environments, twice in temperate regions, and three times in warm, tropical lands to take effect. During the next hour after the last necessary ritual has been performed, an unnatural blizzard gradually strengthens to the point where the area is considered a cold region. Additionally, creatures not native to the cold gain disadvantage on Survival and Perception checks while within the area of your Fimbulwinter. You can choose any number of creatures at the completion of the ritual, granting them immunity to this effect and to exhaustion from being exposed to a cold environment.</p>
			<p class="indent">The blizzard may be maintained by performing the ritual again anywhere within the Fimbulwinter. The area shifts over the next hour to recenter itself over the location of the new ritual. Otherwise, if the ritual is not performed again within 24 hours, the blizzard dissipates over the next hour. Snow and ice created by your Fimbulwinter melt as normal.</p>

			<description>You, your hounds, and your steed ignore difficult terrain while in cold regions. Your hounds and steed also gain resistance to cold damage. While in a cold region any creatures you control create difficult terrain aroudn them in a 10ft radius. At the end of a long rest you can perform a ritual to create a fimbulwinter. This turns the area around you in a 10 mile radius into a cold climate. It must be performed once for mountains and cold environsments, twice in temperate regions, and thrice in warm tropical regions to take effect. An hour after the final ritual is complete a thick blizzard descends. The fimbulwinter can be maintained by performing the ritual anywhere within the fimbulwinter. Any creatures not adapted to the cold suffer disadvantage on survival and perception checks in the region. You can select any number of creatures and grant them immunity to the cold effects and exhausting from the cold. If not maintained the blizzard dissipates after 24 hours and melts as normal.</description>
