			<p>You’ve made a pact with the Eternal Citadel, a massive yet empty bastion that seems to wander between worlds, collecting travelers and releasing them once they agree to serve. The Eternal Citadel communicates through the silent transfer of emotions and feelings – an instinctual sense to follow a course of action, no matter how enigmatic it may seem. An unknown number of people have sworn their allegiance to the Citadel, and few ever meet, but they all serve the same end, known or otherwise: preservation against the forces that seek destruction.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to shield yourself and others from harm. Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to create a mystical barrier of energy. The amount of damage taken is reduced by half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) after applying resistances or vulnerabilities. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 10th level, your connection with the Eternal Citadel deepens, enabling you to call upon it for defense. You learn two spells with the word “wall” in their name that are of 5th level or lower, they count as warlock spells for you, and they do not count against your total spells known. You can’t choose wall of force as one of these spells. You can cast one of these two spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your oath to the Eternal Citadel becomes irrevocable. You no longer age and cannot be magically aged. You also do not require food or water. Additionally, you can call down an onslaught of timeless power from the central spire of the Citadel to burn away the souls of your foes. During your turn, you can use an action to choose a location that you can see within 200 feet of you. An infinitely tall 10-foot-radius cylinder expands in that space, illuminating it with bright otherworldly light. At the start of your next turn, a beam of golden energy shoots down from the sky, and creatures within the area must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, they take 7d6 radiant damage, 7d6 force damage, and are blinded until the start of your next turn. If they succeed, they take half as much damage and are not blinded. This beam passes through obstacles without damaging them. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
