		<description>
			<p>Wealth is the availability of goods and services, and thus is a representation of both power and opportunity. A wealthy benefactor can save a civilization, while a wealthy tyrant can turn the world on its head.</p>
			<p class="indent">You’ve sworn to let nothing stand between you and the accumulation of wealth, as any whim that takes you can be accomplished with the prudent use of overwhelming financial might. You may have attracted the attention of the Currency Conspiracy, for if your greed blinds you to the truth of their work, then they will gladly take you into their ranks</p>
			<h5>Tenets of Avarice</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Avarice are often sworn only to oneself, born of greed, desire, and greater goals.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Take and Keep.</i></b> The more you have, the more you can do. Take what you need and give nothing back without greater gain.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spend and Deliver.</i></b> Everything has a price. Seek wealth so that you can pay it in coin, rather than your own blood.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Blood and Soul.</i></b> There are currencies intangible that must be obtained or protected, for wealth is worthless otherwise.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Wealth and Unity.</i></b> All the money in the world does nothing if you cannot spend it. Join with others and invest in their efforts, so that you may reap the rewards.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Golden Suit.</i></b> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to coat yourself in shining gold for 1 hour. You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your paladin level for the duration. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, gold sprays off your armor, causing the creature to suffer disadvantage on their next attack before the start of their next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hired Help.</i></b> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon a simple magical construct for one hour. This construct has the statistics of a commoner, though it is a construct instead of its normal type. It cannot attack, cast spells, or activate magic items. If it dies or the duration expires, it fades into mist.</p>
