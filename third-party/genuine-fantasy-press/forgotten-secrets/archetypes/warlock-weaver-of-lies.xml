			<p>The speech of a god is the act of creation itself, but what happens when the gods lie? The small accumulated deceptions come together, forming a creature of webs and treachery, lies and deceit. The Weaver, it is called, but it is a being woven from the lies of the gods themselves. Its influence is felt each day, in the small comforts one tells oneself to the greatest of blasphemies against the divine concordant. Spiders toil in service to the Weaver, and you've joined them in your greed.</p>

			<p>When you forge this pact at 1st level, your patron teaches you the first lie ever told. You gain proficiency in the Deception skill, and gain 1d4 temporary hit points whenever you make a Deception skill check. Also, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that targets a single hostile creature, you can use a bonus action to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is poisoned for one round.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you learn to summon the slaves of the Weaver to extract vengeance.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to summon a horde of spiders into the space adjacent to you. They have the same statistics as a Giant Spider (MM 328), except they are Small. These creatures obey your commands and act on your turn. You can summon up to one spider per two warlock levels, and they disappear when slain or after one minute has passed.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your blood flows with poison, yet your words are smooth as honey. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can attempt to charm a single target that speaks a language.The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they are in combat, they have advantage on this saving throw. If they fail, they are charmed for one minute and must obey a single verbal command of your choosing that does not put them in visible danger. After they fail to resist once, they have disadvantage on subsequent attempts to resist. Whenever a creature succeeds on their Wisdom saving throw, all subsequent attempts to resist have advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature that succeeds their Wisdom saving throw is aware that you are attempting to manipulate them, but cannot detect the magical nature of the manipulation without additional senses or detection by magical means.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you finish a short or long rest, the saving throw for all creatures you've attempted to influence resets to normal.</p>
