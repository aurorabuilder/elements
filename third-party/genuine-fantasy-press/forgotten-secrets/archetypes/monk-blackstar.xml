			<p>The night sky has offered peace and solace in times of turmoil, exposing the insignificance of those who walk upon the earth, yet you do not call out for peace. Your meditations have taken you to the void where the Fallen Exile once shined, filling your spirit with a blackened and sorrowful power. This may have come to pass by the intervention of the Exile, spiritual enlightenment you have sought yourself, or the teachings of a master who has traveled this dark path. Regardless of your original intention, your ki has been corrupted by this unnatural void within the cosmic order, granting you the ability to draw it forth to form a deadly weapon of light and eerie blackness. Fueling your techniques with the anguish of your foes, you strive ever closer to understanding the secrets within the eternal black star that lies at the center of the cosmos.</p>
