			<p>You’ve made a pact with the cheerful wandering cubes of sentient ooze that wiggle and wobble their way across the multiverse. They visit worlds beyond measure with the singular goal of spreading their offspring within the deepest dungeons to collect and absorb the memories of the fallen. As they happily bounce between the planes, they occasionally encounter a soul they view as truly amusing. With a mere wave of their pseudopods, they granted you a measure of their strange power over slimes and oozes. Now, their joy is yours.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you learn to dissolve the bodies of the dead and learn from their lives. As an action while standing adjacent to a corpse, you can produce an iridescent acid that consumes the corpse over the course of 1 minute. Once the process has finished, you can reabsorb the acid to access the creature’s memories. You gain information about the creature’s last 48 hours alive and the most  important memories from their final year of life. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, your body becomes somewhat... slimy. Whenever you suffer damage, you can use your reaction to divide into a Medium swarm of Tiny oozes. Your hit points remain the same, and you function as a single unified swarm that occupies the same space as a Medium creature. While in this state, you can’t take actions other than the Dash action, your movement speed is halved, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, you gain immunity to acid and poison damage, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks, and you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. You can return to your normal form at will without using an action, provided there is room to do so. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature at will as an action. Using this feature as a reaction is still limited to once per long rest.</p>
