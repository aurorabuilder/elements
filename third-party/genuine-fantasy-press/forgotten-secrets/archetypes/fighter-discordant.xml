			<p>In battle, blades clash and ring, shields break and snap, warriors yell and scream, and beneath it all, the sound of violence reigns supreme. One sound, however, stands out above the rest in your memory: the eternal song of the Perfect Chord, a manifestation of light and sound that bore witness to your conflict, collecting the cries of the wounded and the yells of the victors before vanishing once more. Inspired by this melody, you have dedicated your martial focus to the creation of dissonance, adjusting the vibrations of the universe to inflict a discordant cacophony of destructive power upon your adversaries. With weapons singing a tale of triumph and despair, you stand valiant before the chaos of everlasting war.</p>

			<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to make your blades sing with destructive energy. While you are wielding a melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to make it ring with sonorous power for one minute. If the weapon leaves your hand, it stops ringing.</p>
			<p class="indent">While a weapon is ringing, it inflicts thunder damage instead of the normal type. Whenever a creature other than you starts its turn within 5 feet if you while your weapon is ringing, it takes thunder damage equal to your highest ability score modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action while holding a ringing weapon, you can unleash this energy, generating sharpened edges of pure sound to lash out in all directions around you and causing the weapon to stop ringing. When you do this, each creature other than you within 15 feet of you takes thunder damage equal to the damage dice of the weapon plus your highest ability score modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can unleash the energy within a ringing weapon twice, and you regain these uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting at 7th level, unleashing this energy inflicts twice as much damage, and it inflicts three times as much damage at 15th level.</p>

			<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to stop noise around you by disrupting your own heartbeat. As a bonus action, you can cast silence centered on yourself. When cast in this way, it requires no verbal, somatic, or material components, lasts until the start of your next turn, and affects a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on you.</p>

			<p>At 10th level, you learn to further manipulate sound and silence. Friendly creatures within 15 feet of you gain resistance to thunder damage. When a hostile creature takes thunder damage as a result of starting its turn within 5 feet of you while your weapon is ringing, it becomes disrupted by eldritch vibrations that interfere with spellcasting. If it tries to cast a spell with a verbal component before the start of your next turn, it takes 2d10 thunder damage immediately after casting the spell. If this would cause it to make a concentration saving throw, it makes this saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

After you use this bonus action, any creature or object other than you within 5 feet of you at any time during your turn takes thunder damage equal to your highest ability score modifier at the end of your turn.</p>

Your heartbeat is as unstoppable as it is unpredictable, and your pulse thunders in your ears.

			<p class="indent">Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to be reduced to 1 hit point instead. Once you do so, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
