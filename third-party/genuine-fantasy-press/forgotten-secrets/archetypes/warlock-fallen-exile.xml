			<p>Stars beyond measure populate the void beyond the world while celestial spheres circle above. You have met with one of their number, cast down by the many cold and unfeeling suns above for the sin of falling in love with a mortal. As punishment, the spiteful and envious stars shined their pale fury upon the paramour, destroying them utterly. The Exile now wanders the world it has been cast upon, appearing as a shimmer of light. Its goal is known only to those whom it trusts, and it grants power to them as it is powerless itself, stripped of interaction with the mortal world for its hubris. It endlessly searches, seeking either a soul of great kindness to help it find the knowledge and power to resurrect its fallen paramour or one unscrupulous enough to wage war upon the very stars themselves. The light shines, but that fire can be cold and merciless, like the wrath of a love destroyed.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, the Exileâ€™s duality of betrayal and compassion infuses your spellcasting, enabling you to reach into the world in the same way that it does. Whenever you cast a spell using a warlock spell slot, you can choose to cast the spell as though you were located in the space of an enemy or ally that you can see within 60 feet. When you cast from the space of an enemy, they take 1d6 radiant damage. When you cast from the space of an ally, they gain 1d6 temporary hit points.</p>

			<p><b>The Chariot</b> When you take the Attack action, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.</p>
			<p><b>Death</b> You gain proficiency in death saving throws.</p>

			<p><b>The Hanged Man</b> You gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws to see through illusions.</p>
			<p><b>The Lovers</b> You have advantage on saving throws against the charmed condition.</p>
			<p><b>The Magician</b> Your spells of 1st level and higher ignore half and three-quarters cover so long as there is nothing between the sky and the target.</p>

			<p><b>Temperance</b> You gain advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern the motives of creatures.</p>
