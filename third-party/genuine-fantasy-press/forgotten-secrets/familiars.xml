		<description>
			<p>The animate image is a small, two-dimensional work of sentient art that shifts and changes to suit its environment. They’re created as servants and spies by warlocks of the Gray Portrait, and by other skillful artisans and craftsmen who spill blood in the name of their art. These images are mischievous and cruel, delighting in taunting former friends into harming one another and making rude gestures to amuse and insult. Most are humanoid, but some are of fantastical animals, imaginary beasts, and even landscapes or scenery. They can change their appearance quite dramatically as suits their mood, and tend to try to occupy picture frames or the exteriors of statues whenever possible.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creation of an animate image is an unusual one, directly related to the art of shadow puppetry. While images can be of any color or form, they are simple when first created. The artist must stand before a burning brazier and establish an eldritch connection with the flame, calling upon it to cast light more fervently. Once done, they will place their hands on the far side of the fire, casting a shadow on the wall or ground. While chanting the eerie words and phrases required by this mystical rite, they will use their hands to make a shadow puppet. The chanting corresponds with a story fitting for the personality of the animate image that they desire to summon. </p>
			<p class="indent">A story of loss and betrayal will call forth an image that takes the shapes of monsters and assassins, while a pleasant story with happy ending will create one that is more mischievous than hateful. Over the course of the ritual, the shadow puppet will solidify, no longer moving with the hands of the artist. At the culmination of the event, the warlock will cut a fingertip and place a single drop of blood on the shadow, infusing it with life, soul, and obedience to its creator. </p>

		<description>
			<p>Animate shields are summoned from the long-silent forges of the Eternal Citadel, made ages ago to defend the servants of the massive fortress from any invader. They rest silently when not addressed or in combat, but are always wary of attackers to the point of paranoia. Most are hesitant to leave the sight of their charge, and will only do so by direct order. They also seem to have a cutting sense of humor, mocking opponents and striking at their minds with subtle magics whenever they are attacked. They have a strange rivalry with other magical objects, especially magical weapons, which they view with disdain and distrust due to their opposing purpose. They are fond of gifts of art and masonry, and adore being painted and encrusted with gemstones when done as a show of ownership and affection.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Not all who have torn their hearts away in the Blackthorn Grove survive their adventures. Some fall in battle, dying before their quests have been completed. For many, this is the end, but for some, it offers a new beginning. Each bloodless wanderer is the blackthorn heart of one of these fallen heroes, whose ambitions and desires were never fulfilled. The heart tears itself from the chest of the fallen adventurer, seeking still to fulfill its quest. They are intelligent and possessed of clear purpose, but cannot speak or write. Many construct masks of wood and decorate them to be reminiscent of the person who they once lived within. All of them require blood to continue to survive, and will feast upon the fallen, drinking deeply of their still-fresh fluids. </p>
            <p class="indent">As companions, they are wise and insightful, possessed of much of the experiences of their former owners. They are often referred to as spirits of the dead, though this is not technically correct. They are plants, living and come to life once more. They desire little more than to find new companions who can assist them on their lifelong quest, but are patient and capable of understanding the bigger picture when required. The one thing that will cause a wanderer to attempt disobedience is the sight of their killer. If a bloodless wanderer is placed within a corpse, it can animate the body to act and move, but it will still lack the ability to communicate beyond gestures and cryptic behavior.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The dimcat is a small feline creature that cloaks itself in shadow, and feeds on the nightmares of the unwary. Servants of the Shadowcat, the dimcats are sent out into the world to safeguard children and guide them away from dangerous situations, often appearing in very small ways to influence events so that the child is unaware of the danger in the first place. While the Shadowcat and its reflections feed on nightmares, those of children are bitter and unworthy of their elegant and refined taste.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures that draw their ire find themselves wreathed in blinding blackness before being bitten by the cat, filling their minds with a psychic onslaught of nightmares. The dimcat feeds on the doubts, fears, and nightmares of sleeping mortal adults, sitting upon them with mouth outstretched to catch the fever dreams as they rise in a black mist. </p>
            <p class="indent">Those who awaken only see the stark blue eyes shining down at them, and are paralyzed by the strange power of the dimcat. When at rest, they are silent and watchful, seeming to enjoy batting out burning candles and other sources of light. Warlocks who have sworn themselves to the Shadowcat often take them as familiars, typically treating the dimcat as an extension of their patron itself. In a certain sense, they really are: each dimcat is a reflection of the Shadowcat that was created when this enigmatic entity consumed and converted a lesser nightmare, twisting the old horror into a new form with a new purpose. </p>
            <p class="indent">Dimcats speak in a wide variety of voices and have many strange and enigmatic personalities, but most can be described as one might expect: haughty, overbearing, demanding, sly, clever, charming, affectionate, enigmatic, mysterious, deceptive, curious, and practically any other term one might use to describe an actual cat.</p>

			<p>An emberborn is a small, canine-like creature created from ash and burning embers built around a core of molten metal. They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some say that the emberborn are the children of the Ashen Wolf, and that it cares for them as though they were its own. There are no reliable records that can prove this belief, but as intelligent elementals they are capable of speech and can thus be asked. As an emberborn feeds and ages, they will grow larger and larger. Some eldritch scholars hypothesize that the Ashen Wolf was once an emberborn, strangely enough.</p>
            <p class="indent">When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The eyeless watcher is a tentacled horror with small wings that speaks in whispers, often repeating the grimmest word it has most recently heard. A new one is born with each secret the Keeper of the Depths learns, and they emerge from the deep dreams of its mind to grace the mortal world with their presence. The watchers are praised and reviled for their unceasing usefulness, but their tentacles bear a poison far deadlier than their servitude. </p>
            <p class="indent">They enjoy causing fear and concern, but seem to do so out of habit more than any actual malice. When at rest, they tend to immerse themselves in water, and flutter their tendrils out to the edges of whatever body of water they have occupied. Most are seemingly brilliant to the minds of ordinary mortals, and whisper secrets from worlds and lifetimes beyond those of any who are present now. They have an interesting rivalry with the Archive’s record-hunters, and seek to safeguard their secrets from being cataloged in such a mundane fashion as literature. Instead, they hold oral traditions as the highest form of knowledge, and seek to share them in the dreams they visit on the nights of a full moon. </p>
            <p class="indent">These horrors are suspected to have been first created as the result the work of the Keeper’s first collection: a series of ancient artifacts found buried within the ruins of a civilization lost to the tides upon a distant world. With these, it called the seas to rise above the land and swallow the entire planet, though the artifacts were destroyed in the process. Countless thousands died that day, and those that remained lived among the corpses and the surf amidst the highest mountaintops. Over time, the Keeper’s unshakable influence over the world grew ever greater, twisting once noble folk into imitations of themselves. They performed rituals over the dead, taking the flesh of their fallen and consuming it themselves. They offered their broken bodies and minds to the Keeper, and it grew ever more powerful.</p>
            <p class="indent">In the end, it discovered that hearing the whispers of those who worshiped it was pleasing, and so it turned its mind to the lost and ancient arts that allowed one to sculpt life from flesh and sentience from dreams. Thus, the eyeless watchers were born, forever whispering the secrets of those who have come and gone for the entertainment of their inhuman master.</p>

		<supports>Familiar, Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The harrowing hawk is a large bird with stone-cold eyes that is infused with merciless ice. Bred as hunting birds by the Wild Huntsman, these creatures are far deadlier than their cruel visage belies. When they swoop down to attack their prey, they freeze the edges of their wings and slash with the ice-coated feathers, leaving the frost in the wound to slow their victim. As the ice builds, they let out a piercing cry to summon their master to strike down the target from afar. When at rest, they tend to rest upon the shoulders of their masters and gaze menacingly at those around them. They enjoy gifts of carved bone and scrimshaw, which they use to make their nests, and feast upon frozen meat with gusto. </p>
            <p class="indent">Harrowing hawks are typically solitary creatures, and rarely cooperate with one another while hunting prey. However, mated pairs are known to hunt together to devastating effect, with one scouting for the other, finding an enticing meal, then letting out a shrill cry. Before the prey can react, the second crashes down with the force of a thunderbolt, slaying the beast instantly. Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.</p>
            <p class="indent">When in the service to a warlock aligned to the Huntsman, they serve as scouts and harbingers to the hounds who pursue the prey, seeking to drive them into the clutches of their master. They have a strong bond with the other beasts of the Huntsman’s stable, though are haughty and typically view themselves as the most favored of beasts. The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master’s affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings.</p>

			<p>Animals on the verge of death sometimes wander into the Forbidden Graveyard, and the carrion birds who come to hover over them are often drawn in as well. As familiar as they are with those on the border of life and death, spirits of the dead occasionally wander back in their grasp, infusing the carrion birds with sinister energies. Their eyes glow with an eerie light, their wings beat silently, and a trail of horrible shadow filled with the grasping hands of those the beast has consumed follows the bird with malevolent intent. They speak in the voices of dead relatives and take pride in their foul mockery of the living, yet often offer wise advice and dangerous secrets to those who have defied death.</p>

		<supports>Familiar, Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike. </p>
            <p class="indent">Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang. If the summoner remains calm and still through this process, they will succeed in the rite, gifting the serpent with life and causing it to become corporeal. If they express emotion or pain, then an agonizing toxin will flood their veins and the ritual will be disrupted.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most servants of the Empress will offer the imperial cobra some form of identifying jewelry, so that it may more clearly express its superiority over all lesser creatures. It serves its master as an equal, subservient only to their wishes by the fact of the magic binding them rather than any true loyalty. The oath of a snake means little, except when it is made to the ruler of the Endless Empire.</p>

		<supports>Familiar, Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The luminous shard is a small humanoid construct made from the crystallized starlight of the Fallen Exile’s tears that were shed when it witnessed the execution of its mortal love. These shards appear as small faceless statues that vaguely resemble the paramour, and are given as a reminder of the grim purpose that drives the servants of this fallen star. They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe.</p>
            <p class="indent">Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment. If they are truthful, then the shard will swear loyalty in a series of gestures and serve faithfully as a familiar from then on. If they are deceptive, then the shard will shed a tear of molten crystal, shatter into fragments, and rejoin the Exile in the skies above.</p>

		<supports>Familiar, Variant Familiar</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The record-hunter is a small, featureless humanoid constructed entirely of paper covered in runic script, generated by the will of the Accursed Archive. These tiny origami figures move with great stealth to avoid the unwanted attentions of the Silent One. Able to track down even the most obscure sources of information, they act as invaluable allies to the archivists. When threatened, they fold into the shapes of fantastical beasts and fly high into the air, their runic scripts pulsing with power as they lash at the minds of their aggressors to silence them and preserve the sanctity of the Accursed Archive. </p>
            <p class="indent">When a record-hunter discovers a new secret, it will peel open, find a quill and ink, and begin to write in tiny, scrawling script on the inside of itself, inscribing the hidden knowledge into its form. When the master of a record-hunter dies, it will return to the Archive and begin a grim and emotionless work. The record-hunter will unfold itself, revealing the countless layers and pages within its body, all covered in the secrets that it has revealed. It will then begin to tear itself apart, silently writhing in agony as it binds itself into a book or scroll. </p>
            <p class="indent">The new tome of secrets will be picked up by the other record-hunters and placed with reverence upon the shelves of the Archive, and a new record-hunter will be manufactured from blood, ink, and eldritch parchment. It is in this way that the Accursed Archive grows and spreads, constantly seeking new archivists to carry its record-hunters forth. The Silent One acts in defiance of these strange constructs, guarding the knowledge of the Archive while acting in a way that will discourage future additions to the collection. Once a written work is within the Archive, it cannot be destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Those who take forbidden tomes from the Archive or bear weapons covered in dark script often act in different capacities, either spreading ruin directly or seeking out ancient writings that have managed to somehow escape the attentions of the Archive.</p>

            <p class="indent">Created ages ago by servants of the Warrior-Saint, these little machines act as record-keepers of all the events that happen in the multiverse. They act in perfect concert, and move with an eerie buzzing noise that can disturb the cowardly. Individual scribeants are relatively harmless and are unable to cause damage, but when they are in a swarm, they can channel their eldritch power to produce startling shocks to those that they are touching.</p>
            <p class="indent">When threatened, they will move with perfect precision to unleash a ray of radiant light from their gemstones, all targeting a single point on their enemy to sear their body and soul. They can also use this light for more mundane purposes, creating murals and inscriptions of things that they have recorded, or simply displaying what they have witnessed and heard. This makes them invaluable to justiciars, as they can display evidence of wrongdoing that is inalterable and unquestionable.</p>
            <p class="indent">To summon a swarm, the brazier is lit and the appropriate oaths are made. The summoner will then begin to play the brazier like a drum, striking the outside with a hand or rod. Unharmed by the flames, they will imitate the buzzing of the scribeant swarm, and when performed properly, it will appear from within the fire ready to serve its purpose.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The shade widow is an eerily silent spider-shaped construct made entirely of animate webbing and shaped obsidian. Created by the Weaver of Lies as assassins, these deadly objects are used to tie up loose ends wherever they arise. They’ll often lie in wait under the beds of unsuspecting victims before emerging to bite with fangs coated in magical poison. Acolytes of the Weaver are fond of them due to their ability to create massive webs, making them invaluable while fleeing from an angry mob after the lies they’ve spun fall to tatters.</p>
			<p class="indent">Summoning a shade widow is a perilous task. After lighting the brazier, the warlock must begin to chant and incant with perfect inaccuracy, deliberately twisting the normal ritual of summoning into something exactly wrong. This process causes eldritch pain to those not accustomed to lying with every breath, burning away at a fragment of the summoner’s soul in order to give life to something false. During this, the summoner will throw sand into the brazier to magically heat, and then pour the resulting glass into the correct form of the shade widow. </p>
			<p class="indent">A final sprinkle of blood is the last ingredient. This blood will become a strange poison that changes the glass to spider web obsidian and grants life and malice to the shade widow. Once it is summoned, the warlock must lie to it once more, claiming to be its true master before all others. Both the warlock and the widow know this to be false, for the shade widows will always be servants to the foul nightmare known as the Weaver of Lies. </p>

			<p>The spark seeker is a small, manta-ray-like creature that floats on the winds and uses them for defense. Once parasites that crawled upon the hide of the Storm Lord, the spark seekers have been touched by the legendary power of the godlike being and have grown and changed, gaining the ability to wield magical energies in exchange for service to the Lord. When threatened, they craft a shard of crystal by compressing the dust in the air around them and firing it at their target after charging it with electricity. When at rest, they scuttle along at a slow pace, finding a nook in some stone to lie in on a side that is exposed to the wind and elements. They enjoy gifts of meat and perfumes, and chirp excitedly when they are carried around. At night, colonies of spark seekers perform elaborate mating dances, lighting up the sky with flashes of lightning and strong gusts of wind. An entire colony of them working in concert can start a summon a massive and terrible storm, making them dangerous when near civilized areas.</p>
			<p class="indent">Summoning one is simple: light the brazier, chant the proper words and praises to the Lord of Storms, extinguish the brazier with water, and then your desired spark seeker will appear from within the resulting fog and steam.</p>

			<p>The symphonic songbird is a colorful avian creature that mimics the voices of others, and can produce a beautiful melody fit for any occasion. They seem to originate from birds that have fallen for the allure of the Perfect Chord and have been touched by the magical emanations that constantly flow from it. Infused with choral power, they speak and sing with the voices of any sounds they have heard. Oddly enough, they seem to prefer being exposed to a constant onslaught of sound when at rest, and will seek out the noisiest place around to build their nests. </p>
			<p class="indent">Colonies of songbirds will form full orchestral symphonies, to the delight of the rare few who are granted an audience. When threatened, they dazzle and strike with wicked beaks, inspiring one another to fight with fervor and fury against all aggressors. They enjoy gifts of fruit and shiny objects, which they use to build elaborate nests. Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. </p>

		<description>
			<p>A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.</p>
			<p class="indent">The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.</p>
			<p class="indent">Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The wiggly cube is a small, colorful, semi-transparent ooze that gently dissolves a little of everything it touches in a quest to experience all the flavors of the multiverse. They are sent down by the greater cubes within the Convocation to learn and grow before eventually returning to the space between the planes where the Gelatinous Convocation makes its home. They’re surprisingly expressive for a simple square of slime, and often bounce and jiggle to express their feelings on a topic. They enjoy consuming corpses and other dead organic material, as they learn more and more about the universe with each meal. When threatened, the cube will resort to violence with an intimidating glee, lashing out with its pseudopods and trying to goad the attacker into engaging in melee combat. Against foes smaller than itself, the cube will rush them and attempt to engulf and consume them. They speak to the minds around them with a childlike innocence even as they feast on dead mortals and beasts alike. When at rest, the cube will seek a stone surface to rest upon, and will wobble slowly back and forth in a pattern seemingly designed to entice the unwary into touching it.</p>

			<p>The cube moves up to its speed. While it does so, it can enter the spaces of other creatures. Whenever the cube enters the space of a hostile creature, and the creature is of the same size or smaller than the cube, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 4 (1d8) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and takes 14 (3d8) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.</p>
