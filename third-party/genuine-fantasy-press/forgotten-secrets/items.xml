		<description>
			<p>Whenever this quill is dipped in the blood of a living creature, it can be used to write one or more words upon that creature’s skin as an action. Those words become true and the target acts as though affected by the geas spell. The target can be written upon multiple times, creating a series of soul-binding instructions that each act as a unique instance of the geas spell. If the creature is targeted with a remove curse spell, only one of the writings is removed each time.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This twisted and bent piece of blackened metal is shaped into a foreboding sigil and is constantly warm to the touch. These sigils are frequently used by Ashenspawn to mark their territory and to brand their greatest warriors and adversaries alike. Whenever it is pressed into a tree, it ignites and adheres fully, becoming permanently affixed. If applied to living flesh, it burns into the skin, dealing 1d10 fire damage and permanently branding the creature as it fuses with their body. The sigil can only be removed from the creature’s body by deliberately cutting it out, a process that deals 10 slashing damage to the creature and takes one minute.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This dagger appears to be crafted out of an unknown gemstone, but it is actually hardened slime. While attuned to it, you gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple, and you can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. When you hit with this weapon, the target is coated in slime until the end of its next turn. A creature coated in slime gains disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and falls prone if it ends its movement on a surface. Creatures who don’t touch surfaces to move are immune to these effects.</p>

			<p>With a blade crafted from hundreds of fine filaments, this dagger is reminiscent of a paintbrush.

Each property only affects attacks made with this dagger. The dagger can contain multiple colors at the same time.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Acid: Green</b> - Damage dealt can’t be healed until the target finishes a short or long rest.</li>
			<li><b>Cold: Blue</b> - On a hit, the target’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 minute. This does not stack.</li>
			<li><b>Fire: Red</b> - The dagger’s base damage increases from 1d4 to 1d8.</li>
			<li><b>Lightning: Yellow</b> - While wielding the dagger, your movement speeds increase by 10 feet.</li>
			<li><b>Necrotic: Black</b> - Attacks made with advantage deal an extra 2d4 necrotic damage.</li>
			<li><b>Psychic: Purple</b>  - While wielding the dagger, you gain immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions. </li>

	<element name="Arcanomathematic Cube" type="Magic Item" source="The Compendium of Forgotten Secrets" id="ID_GFP_COFSA_MAGIC_ITEM_WONDROUS_ITEM_ARCANOMATHEMATIC_CUBE">
		<description>
			<p>This cube of brass is covered in numeric inscriptions. When you speak the correct sequence of numbers and addition signs to equal a prime constant, located at the top of a cube, it produces a string of numbers that correspond to locations on the exterior of the cube. When those locations are touched while the equation is spoken, the cube delivers a message directly to the mind of the operator and shields them from mental influence for the duration of the message. You can then record a new message telepathically while touching it. The cube then resets, the prime constant changes, and the numbers shift to new locations on the exterior. Operating the cube takes a number of minutes equal to 5 minus your Intelligence modifier, to a minimum of one action.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This stringed instrument normally only has three strings, but this one has twenty-four divided among its eight stems, positioned in a circle so that the strings form a web over the center. It is impossible to play correctly by ordinary individuals, but in the hands of the Weaver’s servants, it produces an eerie and unnatural tune. As an action while you are playing this instrument, you can create a static illusion that occupies a 100 foot cube centered on you. This illusion is impossible to see through without truesight, and it can be interacted with as though real. It cannot inflict damage, but it can restrain creatures or otherwise impede their actions. A creature can destroy an illusory restraint using their action. The illusion lasts until the start of your next turn unless you maintain or change it using your action at that time.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This book is wrapped in silver spiderwebs. A person reading this book will only see what they want to see, or what the magic within the book thinks they would benefit from reading. Everything within is incorrect, exaggerated, false, or otherwise in error. The book contains no numbers, including page numbers, and if you attempt to write a number on one of the pages, the book will unleash a hideous scream, causing 2d6 psychic damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the book. This scream is audible up to 300 feet away.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This cloak appears to be made from hundreds of scraps of hide. As an action, you can transform your Book of Shadows into a beast with a CR less than or equal to one-fourth your warlock level. The beast obeys your telepathic commands and acts on your initiative count. It remains in this form until slain or until you use your bonus action to end the effect. Once the cloak has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This hunting horn is covered in symbols depicting each type of prey the Huntsman has slain. As an action at night, you can activate the magic within. Each creature of your choosing that you can see gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed, 50 temporary hit points, advantage on all attack rolls, immunity to cold damage, and truesight out to 120 feet. These benefits last until dawn breaks through the dark curtain of night. If a creature is flying when the magic ends, it descends harmlessly to the ground. Once the horn has been used, it remains dormant until the next Wild Hunt.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This gauntlet was crafted from the hide and talons of a white dragon slain by the Huntsman itself. Once per turn, you can create your pact weapon without using an action, and your pact weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which stacks with other enhancement bonuses it may have. Additionally, you can choose to have your pact weapon deal cold damage instead of its normal damage type. If you kill a creature with your pact weapon, your next attack with it deals an extra 2d10 cold damage.</p>
