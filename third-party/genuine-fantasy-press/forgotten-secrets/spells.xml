			<p class="flavor">There is always a price for power.</p>
			<p>You speak aloud, demanding a boon from one of the darkest planes. You instantly replicate the effects of any spell of 1st level with a casting time of 1 action or bonus action that deals damage, or any cantrip from any spell list. Each time you cast this spell, roll a d20. If the result is 1, you are struck by an unholy force, reducing you to 0 hit points and causing you to fail your first and second death saving throws immediately after the spell is cast. If you are struck down a second time due to this spell before you finish a long rest, you die and cannot be resurrected by a spell cast using a spell slot lower than 8th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level, you can replicate a spell of 2nd level or lower, and the threshold for being struck down increases to a result of 2 or lower. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level, you can replicate a spell of 3nd level or lower, and the threshold for being struck down increases to a result of 3 or lower. This pattern continues until the spell is cast using a slot of 7th or higher level, where no additional effect is gained and the threshold is not increased.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">And so the wrath of the righteous shall shatter mountains.</p>
			<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature or location within the spell’s range. Depending on the damage type the weapon deals, the spell has a different area of effect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Slashing </b>A crescent of energy races from the attack, and each creature in a 20-foot cone in the direction of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
				<li><b>Piercing. </b>A pure beam of energy streams from the attack, and each creature in a 60-foot line, 5 foot wide line must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
				<li><b>Bludgeoning. </b>Explosive energy emanates from the attack, and each creature other than you within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Creatures that fail their saving throw take 2d10 radiant damage, are pushed 10 feet back, and fall prone. A creature that was hit by your attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d10 per slot level above 3rd. </p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The saying “Dead men tell no tales.” isn’t always true.</p>
			<p>You imbue a skull with necromantic magic, granting it an eerie semblance of life. When you cast this spell, you can speak a phrase of 10 words or fewer. Whenever a creature touches the skull or enters a space within 5 feet of it, the skull speaks the phrase. You can also choose to infuse the skull with malicious energy. When you do, once per turn when a creature other than you touches the skull, it will snap at them with its teeth. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 1d4 piercing damage. An animated skull has 6 AC and 1 hit point.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s piercing damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The prophets spoke of the day that the world would stand upon a precipice and stare into the abyss. They did not foresee this.</p>
			<p>You chant a series of commands, calling upon every favor and every force that you can muster, preparing to break reality. You cannot move while you are casting this spell. Every creature within range knows that you are casting this spell, is aware of the consequences, and is aware of your exact location for the entire time that it is being cast. Choose a point that you can see within range. A 1-mile-radius sphere centered on that point erupts in a singular explosion of unspeakable fire. Any creature, including you, that can see that point at the time that the spell is cast is permanently blinded. Nonmagical structures and objects within the radius are destroyed instantly. Creatures in the radius are knocked prone and take 10d10 force damage, 10d10 radiant damage, and 10d10 fire damage. If they die, they are reduced to ash. A massive crater is carved into the ground, and is left burning with sickening energy. Any creature that starts its turn within the crater takes 2d10 radiant damage and 1d10 fire damage. The crater burns for one month. You immediately gain 5 levels of exhaustion after casting this spell, and if this kills you, you cannot be resurrected by any means. </p>

			<p class="flavor">Those are not torches burning in the woods beyond. They are eyes, and they are hungry.</p>
			<p>With a gesture, you summon three flaming wolves made from ash and metal into your space. When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns while it is in effect, you can choose a point within 60 feet of you. When you do, one of the flaming wolves rushes to the target point, and then seeks out the nearest creature within 30 feet of it, making a melee spell attack using your spell attack modifier. If the attack hits, the target takes 4d10 fire damage and must make a Strength saving throw. If the target fails, they are knocked prone. The flaming wolf then immediately returns to your space, coiling around your feet. The wolves have an AC equal to your spell save DC. If a flaming wolf is struck by a weapon or spell attack or is prevented from returning to your space after making an attack, it vanishes. The spell ends when all three wolves are lost, or you lose concentration.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire damage of the wolf’s attack increases by 1d10 per spell slot level above 4th.</p>

			<p class="flavor">Hiding in plain sight is something all the best will boast of, but few can conceal the results.</p>
			<p>You touch a single humanoid corpse that died within the last hour, and imbue it with a foul enchantment. If a creature discovers the corpse that was unaware of it when the spell was cast, they must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they are frightened of the corpse until the end of their next turn and will attempt to move so that they can no longer see it. If the subject attempts to reveal the presence the corpse to any other creature, they immediately forget that they have detected the corpse for one hour. Each time this happens, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed, the spell ends after this instance of temporary memory loss.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 1 week per spell slot level above 1st.</p>

			<p class="flavor">The price has been paid. The contract is made. The night falls, and so rises the blade.</p>
			<p>You whisper a dark oath to a humanoid creature within range, promising their death. Whenever you inflict damage to the target, you can choose to place a layer of a shadowy curse upon them. If the target dies before the end of the duration, you recover hit points equal to the number of layers you’ve applied to the target, and you gain a number of gold pieces equal to the sum of the target’s ability score modifiers. If the creature still lives at the end of the duration, and the curse has not been removed using a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage for each layer applied. If you are dead, the target takes twice as much psychic damage and gains a level of exhaustion. The target is aware of the curse’s effect. </p>

			<p class="flavor">The black lotus only blooms during the solar eclipse, when the nearest star understands its own mortality.</p>
			<p>The first time you take the Attack action during your turn, you can cast this spell to summon a swirl of black lotus petals to surround your weapon, distracting your foes and enabling you to strike with great power. Each successful hit you make with this weapon before the spell ends, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or have a new effect apply. Once you’ve made three weapon attacks, the spell ends.</p>

The pillar is 15 feet tall, 5 feet on each side, covered in cruel spikes, and has a flat top that can be safely stood upon. If a creature is caught between the pillar and another surface, such as a ceiling, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 2d10 bludgeoning damage and fall prone in the nearest open space. If a creature is shoved or pushed against the sides of the pillar, they take 1d6 piercing damage. The pillar can be climbed safely by making an Athletics check with a DC equal to your spell save DC. The pillar has hit points equal to fifteen times your spellcasting modifier (minimum 15) and AC 10.</p>

If you hit a creature, it takes an additional 6d12 force damage. On your subsequent turns, you can use your action to continue your deadly assault. Each time you use this action, it has a different effect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>2nd Use. </b>You teleport up to 60 feet and make a melee weapon attack against all creatures within a 20-footcone. Each creature you hit is knocked prone and takes an additional 6d12 force damage.</li>
				<li><b>3rd Use. </b>You teleport up to 30 feet and make a single melee weapon attack against a creature within reach. If the creature is above half its maximum hit points, this attack inflicts an additional 6d12 force damage. If you hit, the creature is then paralyzed until the end of your next turn.</li>
				<li><b>4th Use. </b> You teleport up to 60 feet into the air and descend, smashing into the ground at a point of your choosing that you can see within 120 feet of your starting point. You take no falling damage, but each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take 6d12 force damage. You then make a melee weapon attack targeting a creature within reach. If you hit, the target takes an additional 8d12 force damage.</li>

			<p class="flavor">Beyond the world, there are things that wait and things that watch. Call to them, greet them, and invite them in. Beware, for they may accept your invitation.</p>
			<p>You invoke the power of the Alrisen whose token you bear to transform an area around you. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as 120-foot cube. If you can cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. Creatures that have been marked by the Alrisen whose token you have used are also immune to the effects, as are creatures who you choose to allow at the time of their entry. </p>
			<p class="indent">The entire lair pulses with eldritch power. Dispel magic cast on the area removes only one of the following effects if it succeeds, not the entire area. That spell’s caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Difficult Terrain. </b>You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with difficult terrain. This terrain appears in a manner fitting for the Alrisen, such as the grasping hands of the dead, eerie tentacles, burning stakes of wood, or semisolid bars of radiant light. The obstacles move aside for and close behind creatures that are immune to this effect.</li>
				<li><b>Otherworldly Inscriptions. </b>You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren’t filled with difficult terrain with murals, runes, scratchings, etchings, or other sigils. A creature that steps on a sigil takes 1d6 damage of a type fitting to the Alrisen patron, as the defensive magic unleashes scorching fire, chilling ocean water, radiant energy, or the cruel necrotic power of the grave. To a creature immune to this effect, the inscriptions whisper in eerie voices or recount the stories of heroes from distant worlds.</li>
				<li><b>Eldritch Servants. </b>You can call forth up to eight servants from the Alrisen whose token you’ve used to cast the spell. These servants are the potential familiars listed for warlocks who’ve chosen the Pact of the Chain feature, or other creatures with a CR of 1 or lower. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the eldritch servants fight until they have drive off or slain the intruders. The servants also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don’t give them commands and no intruders are present, the servants do nothing other than patrol and dwell within the lair. The servants can’t leave the otherworldly lair.

			<p class="flavor">In the deepest abyss below the ocean waves, the darkness whispers of sailor’s graves.</p>
			<p>You open a portal to a watery abyss beneath the feet of a creature that you can see within range, which attempts to abduct the target before immediately sealing shut. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they fall in and are immediately dragged 60 feet down by a fierce current. They begin to drown, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of their turns. Each turn that they fail, they gain one level of exhaustion. A creature cannot move normally while in this abyss. Instead, they must use their action to attempt to ascend. The creature must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If they succeed, they swim 20 feet towards the surface. If they reach the surface or you lose concentration on the spell, the spell ends and they are ejected prone at the point they departed from. If they die, they do not return.</p>

			<p class="flavor">There are techniques within the darker arts against which there is no defense.</p>
			<p>You expand your senses and attune yourself to the shadowed planes, detecting the exact locations of all creatures within range until the end of your current turn. Choose one creature that you have detected with this spell. An umbral claw of darkness made manifest rips through the creature, inflicting 4d10 force damage. If the creature is slain, their body vanishes into shadow, leaving their clothing and equipment behind. A creature slain by this spell can be resurrected, but only by a spell that does not require a corpse.</p>

			<p class="flavor">Partnership is two minds acting with a singular purpose.</p>
			<p>You make a simple gesture, indicating to an allied creature within range that they should perform an action and sending a telepathic message of 25 words or fewer. The target chooses either the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Attack (single weapon attack only), or Cast a Spell (a cantrip with a casting time of one action) actions. The target uses their reaction to perform that action. You also take the same action as part of casting this spell.</p>

			<p class="flavor">The sky calls to us, seeking our return to its embrace.</p>
			<p>You attempt to hurl a creature into the air, shifting them partially into the Ethereal Plane. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within range. If you hit, you grasp the target and throw them up to 150 feet directly upward. The creature passes through obstacles unimpeded and unharmed. If the final destination is impeded, the creature is moved to the nearest open space and takes force damage equal to the number of 5-foot increments it was moved. If the creature is an ally, damage it would take from falling is reduced by 100 until the start of your next turn.</p>

			<p class="flavor">When you stare into a shining slime, are you seeing a reflection, or a self that could be?</p>
			<p>You summon a wall of colorful ooze at an unoccupied space within range. The wall appears on a solid surface within range and lasts for the duration. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or have it appear and enclose a 15-foot cube while being up to 5 feet thick. The wall heavily obscures vision through it, but is slightly transparent. Creatures and objects can pass through the wall, but if they do, their movement speed is halved until the start of their next turn. Ranged attacks that would pass through the wall automatically miss and damage the wall instead. The wall of ooze has AC 5, immunity to poison and acid damage, and has 120 hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the wall appears, each creature within the area must make a Strength saving throw to break free from the thick slime, exiting into the nearest unoccupied space if they succeed. Creatures that fail, or creatures that end their turn within the wall, take 4d8 acid damage. Whenever a creature strikes the wall with a melee attack or passes through the wall for the first time during a turn, the creature takes 2d8 acid damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the acid damage of each phase increases by 1d8 and the wall gains 20 additional maximum hit points per slot level above 5th.</p>

			<p class="flavor">A clever hunter is patient.</p>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you place the sharpened metal on the ground and transform it into a frostbound bear trap that occupies a 5-foot square. This trap is nearly invisible, and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to detect it and a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to disarm it. The DC for these checks is equal to your spell save DC. </p>
			<p class="indent">The first time a creature enters the area occupied by this trap, it triggers, it reveals itself, and clamps shut. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

			<p class="indent">A creature caught in the trap can be freed by using an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is freed from the trap. Once a creature is freed from the trap, or the trap is disarmed, the spell ends and the trap vanishes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the piercing or cold damage (your choice) increases by 1d10 per slot level above 2nd.</p>
