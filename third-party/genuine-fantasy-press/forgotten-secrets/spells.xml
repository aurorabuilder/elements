	    <p><em>There is always a price for power.</em></p>
	    <p>You speak aloud, demanding a boon from one of the darkest planes. You instantly replicate the effects of any spell of 1st level with a casting time of 1 action or bonus action that deals damage, or any cantrip from any spell list. Each time you cast this spell, roll a d20. If the result is 1, you are struck by an unholy force, reducing you to 0 hit points and causing you to fail your first and second death saving throws immediately after the spell is cast. If you are struck down a second time due to this spell before you finish a long rest, you die and cannot be resurrected by a spell cast using a spell slot lower than 8th level.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level, you can replicate a spell of 2nd level or lower, and the threshold for being struck down increases to a result of 2 or lower. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level, you can replicate a spell of 3nd level or lower, and the threshold for being struck down increases to a result of 3 or lower. This pattern continues until the spell is cast using a slot of 7th or higher level, where no additional effect is gained and the threshold is not increased.</p>

	    <p><em>And so the wrath of the righteous shall shatter mountains.</em></p>
	    <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature or location within the spellâ€™s range. Depending on the damage type the weapon deals, the spell has a different area of effect:></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Slashing.<strong> A crescent of energy races from the attack, andeach creature in a 20-foot cone in the direction of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
        <li><strong>Piercing.<strong> A pure beam of energy streams from the attack, and each creature in a 60-foot line, 5 foot wide line must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
        <li><strong>Bludgeoning.<strong> Explosive energy emanates from the attack, and each creature other than you within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Creatures that fail their saving throw take 2d10 radiant damage, are pushed 10 feet back, and fall prone. A creature that was hit by your attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></p> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d10 per slot level above 3rd.</p>

	    <p><em>The saying "Dead men tell no tales." isn't always true.</em></p>
	    <p>You imbue a skull with necromantic magic, granting it an eerie semblance of life. When you cast this spell, you can speak a phrase of 10 words or fewer. Whenever a creature touches the skull or enters a space within 5 feet of it, the skull speaks the phrase. You can also choose to infuse the skull with malicious energy. When you do, once per turn when a creature other than you touches the skull, it will snap at them with its teeth. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 1d4 piercing damage. An animated skull has 6 AC and 1 hit point.</p>
	    <p>This spell's piercing damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

	    <p><em>The prophets spoke of the day that the world would stand upon a precipice and stare into the abyss. They did not foresee this.</em></p>
	    <p>You chant a series of commands, calling upon every favor and every force that you can muster, preparing to break reality. You cannot move while you are casting this spell. Every creature within range knows that you are casting this spell, is aware of the consequences, and is aware of your exact location for the entire time that it is being cast. Choose a point that you can see within range. A 1-mile-radius sphere centered on that point erupts in a singular explosion of unspeakable fire. Any creature, including you, that can see that point at the time that the spell is cast is permanently blinded. Nonmagical structures and objects within the radius are destroyed instantly. Creatures in the radius are knocked prone and take 10d10 force damage, 10d10 radiant damage, and 10d10 fire damage. If they die, they are reduced to ash. A massive crater is carved into the ground, and is left burning with sickening energy. Any creature that starts its turn within the crater takes 2d10 radiant damage and 1d10 fire damage. The crater burns for one month. You immediately gain 5 levels of exhaustion after casting this spell, and if this kills you, you cannot be resurrected by any means.</p>

    <description>
	    <p><em>Those are not torches burning in the woods beyond.<br />They are eyes, and they are hungry.*</p>
	    <p>With a gesture, you summon three flaming wolves made from ash and metal into your space. When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns while it is in effect, you can choose a point within 60 feet of you. When you do, one of the flaming wolves rushes to the target point, and then seeks out the nearest creature within 30 feet of it, making a melee spell attack using your spell attack modifier. If the attack hits, the target takes 4d10 fire damage and must make a Strength saving throw. If the target fails, they are knocked prone. The flaming wolf then immediately returns to your space, coiling around your feet. The wolves have an AC equal to your spell save DC. If a flaming wolf is struck by a weapon or spell attack or is prevented from returning to your space after making an attack, it vanishes. The spell ends when all three wolves are lost, or you lose concentration.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire damage of the wolfâ€™s attack increases by 1d10 per spell slot level above 4th.</p>

	    <p><em>Hiding in plain sight is something all the best will boast of, but few can conceal the results.</em></p>
	    <p>You touch a single humanoid corpse that died within the last hour, and imbue it with a foul enchantment. If a creature discovers the corpse that was unaware of it when the spell was cast, they must make a Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they are frightened of the corpse until the end of their next turn and will attempt to move so that they can no longer see it. If the subject attempts to reveal the presence the corpse to any other creature, they immediately forget that they have detected the corpse for one hour. Each time this happens, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed, the spell ends after this instance of temporary memory loss.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 1 week per spell slot level above 1st.</p>

	    <p><em>The price has been paid. The contract is made.<br />The night falls, and so rises the blade.</em></p>
	    <p>You whisper a dark oath to a humanoid creature within range, promising their death. Whenever you inflict damage to the target, you can choose to place a layer of a shadowy curse upon them. If the target dies before the end of the duration, you recover hit points equal to the number of layers youâ€™ve applied to the target, and you gain a number of gold pieces equal to the sum of the targetâ€™s ability score modifiers. If the creature still lives at the end of the duration, and the curse has not been removed using a remove curse spell or similar magic, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage for each layer applied. If you are dead, the target takes twice as much psychic damage and gains a level of exhaustion. The target is aware of the curseâ€™s effect.</p>

The pillar is 15 feet tall, 5 feet on each side, covered in cruel spikes, and has a flat top that can be safely stood upon. If a creature is caught between the pillar and another surface, such as a ceiling, they must make a Dexterity saving throw.

If they fail, they take 1d4 piercing damage.</p>
        <p>This spellâ€™s piercing damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4), and the spellâ€™s thunder damage also increases by 10 at each of these levels.</p>

    <description>
	    <p><em>To make a mortal crave freedom, give them a cage. To make a mortal crave order, set them free.</em></p>
	    <p>As you cast this spell, you create a cage of thorned briars that surrounds a 10-foot cube within range. The briars are thick and only allow a small amount of light and air to pass through, providing three-quarters cover to creatures within and total cover to creatures outside. You, and any others you designate, can pass through the cage at will. The briar cage has AC 10, 200 hit points, and vulnerability to fire. A creature that hits the cage with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, such as a bite or claw, takes 1d4 piercing damage.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the cageâ€™s hit point total increases by 20 per spell slot level above 4th.</p>

	    <p><em>Blood will rain upon the battlefield, and a single warrior will stand alone before the armies of heaven and hell.</em></p>
	    <p>When you cast this spell, you teleport 120 feet and make a melee weapon attack against all creatures within your reach. Roll a single attack for all targets. If you hit a creature, it takes an additional 6d12 force damage. On your subsequent turns, you can use your action to continue your deadly assault. Each time you use this action, it has a different effect:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>2nd Use.<strong> You teleport up to 60 feet and make a melee weapon attack against all creatures within a 20-footcone. Each creature you hit is knocked prone and takes an additional 6d12 force damage.</li>
        <li><strong>3rd Use.<strong> You teleport up to 30 feet and make a single melee weapon attack against a creature within reach. If the creature is above half its maximum hit points, this attack inflicts an additional 6d12 force damage. If you hit, the creature is then paralyzed until the end of your next turn.</li>
        <li><strong>4th Use.<strong> You teleport up to 60 feet into the air and descend, smashing into the ground at a point of your choosing that you can see within 120 feet of your starting point. You take no falling damage, but each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution savingthrow. If they fail, they take 6d12 force damage. You then make a melee weapon attack targeting a creature within reach. If you hit, the target takes an additional 8d12 force damage.</li>

	    <p><em>The freezing cold of the desert night compares favorably to the burning sunlight.</em></p>
	    <p>You unleash a burst of frozen fire at a target you can see within range, which manifests as a missile of ever-changing ice glowing with a crackling heart. Each creature in a line 5 feet wide and 120 feet long must make a Dexterity saving throw, starting with the creature closest to you. The spell impacts the first creature in the line that fails their saving throw, inflicting 2d8 cold damage. If all targets succeed, the projectile continues in a straight line until it impacts a surface. Once the projectile impacts something or reaches the end of the line, it detonates in a blast of fire. All objects and creatures within 10 feet of the detonation take 1d8 fire damage, and unattended flammable objects are ignited.</p>
        <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, either the cold or fire damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 per slot level above 2nd.</p>
