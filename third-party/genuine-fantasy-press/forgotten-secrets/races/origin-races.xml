		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>While the dragon blood that flows through your veins remains potent and powerful, it has been greatly changed by the influence of the Alrisen upon your bloodline. Your appearance will shift due to your altered bloodline, often leading to strange scale patterns, partial absence of scales, or even a nighhuman appearance rather than a draconic visage, depending on the origin. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Draconic Ancestry and Breath Weapon racial features, but do not gain the Damage Resistance feature or any other racial features. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and your size is Medium.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Dwarvish bloodlines are uncommon to see in the ranks of the Alfallen, though not quite as rare as one might expect. Most dwarvish Alfallen retain their dwarvish stature, though many find themselves without the natural resistances, cultural instruction, and visual acuity that their heritage might grant. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Dwarven Toughness racial feature and you gain darkvision out to 30 feet. Your base walking speed is 25 feet, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, and your size is Medium.</p>

			<p>Elven bloodlines are surprisingly open to the influence of the Alrisen, though they retain much of the strange physiological changes brought upon them by the magic of the fey. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Darkvision, Fey Ancestry, and Trance racial features of an elf. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and your size is Medium.</p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Alfallen of Gnomish heritage are surprisingly stable in the quirks of their bloodline, retaining their unusual curiosity and cheerful demeanor, as well as that special resistance to magical influence; however, exposure to eldritch forces has had unusual effects on their physiology nevertheless. </p>
			<p class="indent">When you would fail a saving throw against a spell effect, you can choose to succeed instead. You can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You also gain the Darkvision racial feature of a gnome. Your base walking speed is 25 feet, and your size is Small.</p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p> Humans are the most common Alfallen races, comprising the vast majority of pact-makers and their descendants. Most attempt to conceal their mixed heritage, preferring not to face persecution or estrangement due to the decisions of their ancestors. Others are less fearful, choosing to embrace their strange bloodline. Many who have strong ties to the Alrisen often find themselves drawn once again to the same powers as those their ancestors once sought, seeking to right the wrongs done against them, discover their past, or write a new chapter in their lives. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain proficiency in two skills of your choosing and one language of your choosing. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and your size is Medium.</p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Half-elves whose lineage is touched by the Alrisen manifest traits very similar to those of humans, losing their fey heritage, though their appearance is slightly different and they retain the extended lifespans of their elven kin. Many who have strong ties to the Alrisen often find themselves drawn once again to the same powers as those their ancestors once sought, seeking to right the wrongs done against them, discover their past, or write a new chapter in their lives. </p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>A humble yet boisterous folk who often get over their heads, Alfallen halflings typically make up about one-fourth of the Alfallen population in a given world. Nevertheless, they retain their small stature and surprising luck, granting them remarkable success in all of their pursuits. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Lucky, Brave and Halfling Nimbleness racial features. Your base walking speed is 25 feet, and your size is Small.</p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>While half-orcs are already a rare breed, Alfallen half-orcs are especially uncommon and often viewed as curiosities rather than a genuine racial category. Most are deprived of their original culture, growing up as either slaves or outcasts even among orcish societies, though some will rise to power and greatness thanks to their Alfallen bloodline. Still, they all seem to retain the burning determination of an orc combined with the passionate nature of humanity. </p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Relentless Endurance and Darkvision racial features. Your speed is 30 feet, and your size is Medium.</p>

		<supports>Alfallen Origin Race</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Tieflings are among the most unusual of the Alfallen races, for their fiendish bloodlines provide them a substantial amount of magical power already. While many retain the horns, tails, and scarlet skin of a fiend, others find themselves more easily warped by the influence of the Alrisen, seeing their fiendish traits overridden by the equally exotic appearances of the Alfallen. This vulnerability to the influence of the Alrisen, combined with their exotic appearances, makes them outcasts in all but the most welcoming communities. Individuals who would be born tieflings but have their fiendish heritage entirely purged by the influence of the Alrisen would often be classified under the human, elvish, halfling, or dwarvish racial origins instead.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the Infernal Legacy racial feature. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and your size is Medium.</p>
