        <description>
            <p>Blood is life, and life is pain. Suffering. Fear. Doubt. Sweet sorrow and bitter loss swirl together into a maddening spiral that brings a smile to the face and a tear to the eye. All things end, eventually. Ruin comes in the darkness, watching and waiting for a moment of weakness to begin the gradual corruption and destruction of oneâ€™s soul and humanity. The Archive is that which waits, and the maledicti are the twisted results of that foul patience, driven mad by the constant scratching of quills upon flesh and the ink that flows through their veins like blood. They smile, because they know it will all come to an end.</p>
            <h4>CURSED BY THE ACCURSED</h4>
            <p>The maledicti first were spawned in the darkness of the Archive when curious and cruel archivists sought to discover if the Silent One was deterred by innocent children. These archivists were slaughtered to the last by the monstrosity and dragged to the darkest places below to be subjected to unspeakable ends. The children, however, were left unharmed and trapped in the upper halls, incapable of leaving. Time does not pass properly in the Archive, but the unholy and subtle sentience of the library could not resist the opportunity to create a new and twisted weapon in its endless war against the forces of preservation.</p>
            <p class="indent">The ink-blood of countless fiends and aberrations was drawn forth from ancient tomes of lore and forbidden magic, and it crept into the hands of the children as they huddled, forcing terrible knowledge upon their minds even as they grew quickly to maturity. The scratching of the quills and the war shouts of the fiends filled them with cunning and knowledge of war, while the twisted ink-blood in their veins made them strong and mighty.</p>
            <h4>MADDENED BY THE ARCHIVE</h4>
            <p>Remade and reborn as twisted reflections of their former selves, the accursed children, the maledicti, departed the Archive for the first time to paint a stain across the world. Over time, their descendants have managed to gradually free themselves from the virulence of the curse, but more still return to the Archive seeking power. Archivists who have devoted themselves entirely to the ruinous cause of the Accursed Archive are often transformed into maledicti, seeking the frightening strength of fiendish blood for their own purposes, unafraid of the consequences upon their own mind. They had already lost their sanity long ago. </p>
            <h4>EERIE VISAGE</h4>
            <p>The most startling things about a maledicti are their eyes and hands. Universally, their eyes are pure red, and black veins creep down their face from their tear ducts and the corners of their eyes. Their hands are even more disturbing, always stained black from the ink-blood underneath their skin. Their fingers are sharp and pointed, reminiscent of writing quills or spikes, and they have an unfortunate tendency to use them to scrawl upon surfaces and skin around them. Ink-blood flows smoothly from their fingertips, quickly staining anything they touch a deep and inescapable black. Dark veins run up their forearms, giving them a corrupted appearance. The most disturbing part of a maledicti is their mad and terrifying smile. Each one suffers from some unique insanity, and while most maintain a careful grasp on reality, they can rarely shake the unsettling grin that is the hallmark of their madness.</p>
            <h4>RUINED MINDS</h4>
            <p>The maledicti are insane by all conventional senses of the word. They speak to things that are invisible to others, write unsettling phrases upon seemingly innocent objects with their quill-like claws, and cackle with laughter even when none have told a joke. Most are innocuous in their madness, only descending into psychopathic behavior when their black blood has been spilled upon the ground. Most do not bother to bring about small ruinations, instead working towards ones far grander. Maledicti would agree that toppling a kingdom and sending a civilization into a chaotic spiral towards destruction is much more worthwhile than torturing an enemy or frightening a friend, seeing the latter as beneath them. Ruin is about results, after all.</p>
            <h4>IN CRIMSON DARKNESS</h4>
            <p>Communities of maledicti are hierarchical, with the eldest and most accomplished naturally rising to the top. Maledicti are naturally clever and cunning, leading them to make long and devilish plans even when considering mundane tasks. They are shunned by polite society and must conceal their nature to rise to power or prestige. Those who manage to reach the top are prone to encouraging corruption and dissent in the lower ranks, ruling like tyrants. Not all maledicti are truly evil, nor are all forces of chaos, but the curse laid upon them by the Archive makes them prone to the temptations of dark powers and eldritch rites. Those who shun their heritage are inevitably drawn to adventure, seeking to cause ruin to groups more deserving of their special touch. Many are fond of elaborate tattoos that conceal or highlight their ink-black veins, telling of their deeds using their parchment-like skin as a canvas. Maledicti are often drawn to wizardry, possessing a certain knack for it thanks to their Archival memories, while others favor their fiendish strength to lead them to victory in battle. No matter their path, a maledicti will inevitably stain the world as red as the skies above the Archive.</p>
            <h4>SCRIBES OF SUFFERING</h4>
            <p>Dragonborn maledicti appear as though they were dipped in ink and left to dry, with pale scales across much of their bodies and dark scales upon their hands and legs. Other than their red eyes, they appear surprisingly ordinary, as it can be difficult to see the smile upon a face such as theirs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dwarven maledicti are uncommon but are banished or killed whenever they are found. They are known in dwarven culture for attempting to cause cave-ins or earthquakes and are viewed as menaces to society and goodly folk.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elven maledicti appear to look like ravens, in a sense, possessing long quill-feathers that seem to grow from their hair. Their hands and feet are often shaped into the talons of a bird, and many grow feathers along their arms. Their faces still possess a striking elvish beauty, though the red eyes and black veins reveal their true nature to even the most casual observer. They are welcomed amongst the dark elves, as their propensity for chaos is legendary, and shunned by the others of their kind.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gnomish maledicti often try to blend with their original society and are largely successful. Their innate cunning allows them to keep up with other gnomes, and their appearances can be explained by magical accidents or dormant curses. Their gnomish heritage allows them to resist the call of their madness better than most, though it remains ever present nonetheless.</p>
            <p class="indent">Halfling maledicti often appear to human eyes as corrupted children, causing fear and distress wherever they are seen. They are unwelcome in the normally benevolent halfling communities and often seek to wreak revenge among their former people.</p>
            <p class="indent">Human and half-orc maledicti are the most common, as unsuspecting human children are easily drawn into the Archive thanks to their natural curiosity. Those who are transformed into maledicti after sealing a pact with the Archive are also often human, having delved too deeply into the eldritch secrets within.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tiefling maledicti suffer the darkest fate of any. Pitch black feathers, sharp and pointed at the edges, burst painfully from parchment-pale skin. Horns twist into unnatural shapes, and bone spurs erupt through their skin, growing in long ridges along their extremities. Their eyes burn with fiendish fire and eldritch magic, as their already-tainted blood is driven wild by the hellish nature of their lineage. Their mouths are often filled with hundreds of tiny razor-sharp teeth, and their smiles are by far the most disconcerting of any. They always have the hands and feet of a raven, and many are mistaken for harpies from a distance. Tiefling maledicti are horrifying to behold and often the maddest of them all.</p>
            <h4>MALEDICTI TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a maledicti, your cursed blood fills you with power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Choose either Strength or Intelligence. That ability score increases by two, while the other score increases by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of a maledicti is doubled. All are instantly raised to adulthood, though they can become aged afterward.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most maledicti tend to be evil, chaotic, or both, though some can withstand their dark urges.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Black Blood. </i></b>Your blood is cursed and it marks everything it touches. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. If you would also gain this resistance from a class feature, you learn the shadowthorn cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Madness. </i></b>Your insanity makes it difficult for others to discern your true intentions. Creatures that make Insight checks against you do so with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Quill Claws. </i></b>Your fingers are deadly implements that drip with black ink-blood. Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Maledicti are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
