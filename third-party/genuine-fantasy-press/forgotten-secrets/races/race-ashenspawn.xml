        <description>
            <p>The Ashen Wolf is a creature whose blessings and curses are often indistinguishable from one another. Those who have made pacts with the Wolf may find themselves transformed and changed, with skin covered in burning embers and ashen wood, teeth elongated in a lupine visage, and limbs distorted in strange and eerie ways. If an individual goes untouched by the twisting magic of the Wolf’s gifts, then they still are unsafe, often siring or mothering children who are touched by the magic of the Hungering Flame.</p>
            <h4>KIN TO THE WOLF</h4>
            <p>Ashenspawn are relatively uncommon and are often mistaken for tieflings, fire elementals, or even fiends by those unfamiliar with the Alrisen. Burning embers often drift gently from their skin, smoldering like a fire that recently burned out. While these flames are harmless and incapable of igniting other objects, they do lend an eerie cast to the appearance of an ashenspawn. Many have eyes that glow red, orange, yellow, or blue, like the tip of a burning flame, and flare or dim in response to the ashenspawn’s emotions. While many have a skin tone that one would expect from their race, others are coated in a thin layer of pale or dark ash. Almost all have teeth of blackened steel, hinting at their ability to consume wood and metal the way one would eat a heavily charred steak.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dragonborn are often changed in a way that conceals their ordinary color, their normal scales replaced with scales made of burning wood or glowing metal, and their horns become shiny chrome covered in a layer of soot. </p>
            <p class="indent">Dwarven ashenspawn are often taller than their natural kin, with beards filled with burning embers. They are often even more accomplished blacksmiths than other dwarves, though their affinity for the Alrisen makes them pariahs in their community.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elves tend to become more lupine in response to their normal affinity for the natural world, growing furred ears and long burning manes. Among elvish communities, ashenspawn are viewed as an unfortunate part of the natural order and are treated with pity or quietly shunned.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gnome and halfling ashenspawn are exceptionally uncommon, but they rarely show strong traits of their lineage, instead receiving glowing eyes and sharp features. </p>
            <p class="indent">Humans and half-orcs have the widest variety of expressions of this cursed blessing, as one might expect, and are the most common. Some appear as flaming werewolves with disjointed limbs and long faces. Others look like natives to the Elemental Plane of Fire, with flaming hair and smoke coiling around their hands. A rare few show no trace of their heritage until exposed to extreme heat, their skin growing dark and gnarled like an ancient oak until the fire is gone. </p>
            <p class="indent">Tieflings often show all of these traits and more, appearing as true fiends to the uninformed. Their metal horns, burning tails, skin covered in scarred wood, flaming brand-marks, eyes of fire that bleed black smoke, and long lupine tongues make them fearsome to behold. </p>
            <h4>HUNTERS AND MERCENARIES</h4>
            <p>In societies where ashenspawn are numerous enough to be a significant population group, they are often seen as excellent warriors and raiders, though they often lack the ironclad discipline of a true soldier-race. They make excellent smiths thanks to their natural affinities to flame, metal, and burning wood, and they are also renowned as hunters. These subcultures are typically sedentary and establish settlements near volcanoes or forested regions. Those who fully embrace their lineage often become raiders, pyromancers, and bounty hunters. </p>
            <p class="indent">The arcane arts are looked upon as a method for reaching further strength, leading many to embrace their sorcerous power. Others return to their patron and forge their own pact, for the Ashen Wolf is generous and kind to those it calls kin. Of course, it’s kindness is often a cruelty, as the rest of the world rarely sees ashenspawn as anything more than demons and unholy fiends. Those who are marked in less visible ways typically have an easier time blending in with polite society, bathing in sand to cleanse themselves of ash and covering the glowing brands upon their bodies with clothing and cosmetics. </p>
            <p class="indent">In extraplanar locations where sentient fire elementals and fiends gather to drink and carouse, ashenspawn will prepare drinks filled with flecks of gold, steel, and the blood of slain animals and consume the weapons of those who fought against them, as they possess an uncanny ability to eat wood and metal without harm. This makes them very hardy in the wilderness and leads them to avoid settling in places without trees or heavy foliage, despite their obvious affinity for fire. Water, while not harmful to them, is distinctly uncomfortable and is thus avoided whenever possible. Their natural fiery tendencies make them very unsuitable for life aboard flammable ships, so a seafaring ashenspawn would be a rarity among rarities.</p>
            <h4>Ashenspawn TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a Ashenspawn, your cursed blood fills you with power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Choose either Strength or Charisma. That ability score increases by two, while the other score increases by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>Ashenspawn can live as long as others of their origin race, though most die to violence long before then.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Ashenspawn are influenced strongly by the nature of the Ashen Wolf, and cruelty comes easily to most. While most are not truly evil or chaotic, very few tend to be genuinely good or lawful. Most value fulfilling their own passionate desires and fervent hunger, even at the cost of others, so most are neutral, chaotic, evil, or some combination of the three.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision. </i></b>Due to your lupine eyes that glow in the dark, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you gain Darkvision from your racial origin, add both values together.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Gift of Ash. </i></b>Ashenspawn are blessed with an exceptional resistance to flame, as it fills their form with power and might. You gain resistance to fire damage. If you would also gain this resistance from a class feature, your inner power awakens, granting you the ability to cast the scorch cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Flaming Feast. </i></b>Thanks to your relation to the Wolf, you can easily consume wood, metal, and raw meat without harm, and they provide you with sustenance. You can eat nonmagical wood and metal at the same rate you could consume normal food as your jaws and teeth are strong enough to allow you to bite through iron if you can get your mouth around it. Stronger metals are tough and may take several minutes to bite through, depending on their thickness. Magical metals are too durable for ashenspawn to consume using this feature. Eating metal produces a terrible screeching sound that can be easily heard up to 150 feet away.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Ashenspawn are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
