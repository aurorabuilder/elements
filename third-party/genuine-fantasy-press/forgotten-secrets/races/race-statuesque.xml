        <description>
            <p>The beauty of the Eternal Citadel is eerie and strange, given form by the radiant light of preservation that rests between the twin spires of the central keep. In that light, those who are old, withered, and frail begin to change to suit the needs of the Citadel. They are not allowed to die or age, instead being embraced by the solid light around them. The power of the Eternal Citadel restores strength to weary limbs, fitness to worn minds, and light to dreary eyes. The things that these elders have seen must be preserved and used to great effect, for if they were lost to time, the world would suffer for it. These individuals are known as statuesque, for they become as living stone and statuary come to life.</p>
            <h4>IMMORTAL HEROES</h4>
            <p>Not all statuesque are those transformed by the Citadel from a mortal state. As time goes on and mortal heroes die, statues are constructed in their honor, fabricated from stone and metal in remembrance of their great virtue and sacrifice. All those who look upon these monuments with love, hate, praise, fear, joy, and sorrow add credence to the names of these champions for all of eternity. </p>
            <p class="indent">When ruin and destruction come for a place where these monuments have been carefully preserved and maintained for at least a century, the Citadel may invoke a fraction of its eldritch power, calling forth the collected memories and emotions associated with the champion. In a flash of radiant light, the statue will come to life, cast in the form of one of the heroes of old.</p>
            <h4>FIRST AWAKENING</h4>
            <p>These are awakened statuesque, and they are not reincarnations of the real heroes of the past. They are fabricated beings, assembled from the endless stories and emotions of those who looked upon the monument in awe. They firmly believe themselves to be heroic and take up the names and tasks of their former stations. Those known as skilled combatants or fearsome spellcasters intrinsically gain a fraction of the abilities of their supposed selves and know all of the legends and history surrounding their false past. </p>
            <p class="indent">Many will mistake them for who they resemble and may bear grudges or offer help in turn. If two awakened statuesque of the same hero meet, the reaction is impossible to predict, but rarely does it end in death for one or both. There is a duty that must be fulfilled, for even false heroes can be real ones.</p>
            <h4>MARBLE AND METAL</h4>
            <p>The statuesque are precisely as they sound in regards to their appearance, with clear musculature and bodies many would describe as the pinnacle of physical achievement. Strong and imposing, they appear to be heroes in their prime, tempered with age and experience.</p>
            <p class="indent">The most curious and noteworthy thing about the statuesque is their skin and flesh. They are made entirely from stone, metal, gemstones, and other inorganic substances. The most common appear to be made from marble, with a color similar to their original skin tone. Some are made from obsidian or other natural glasses, while others are comprised of forged metal. Most have smooth skin that is fine and reflective, while some are rough and matte.</p>
            <h4>HONORED AND FEARED</h4>
            <p>Dragonborn statuesque are relatively common and are commonly crafted from stone or metal that matches their original color. Chromatic dragonborn are usually made from stone, while metallic dragonborn are almost always comprised of their respective metal. They are often revered among their culture for their courage and perseverance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dwarven statuesque are the most common, as many of the virtues upheld in dwarven culture are strongly compatible with the ideals of the Citadel. Awakened statuesque are viewed as paragons of community and history and are told of their nature as manufactured souls.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elvish statuesque are rare, especially transformed ones. Elven longevity leads to few truly old elves that would be susceptible to the influence of the Citadel. Awakened statuesque are treated as though they are the originals reborn, regardless of the truth of the matter.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gnomish statuesque are uncommon, but the connection some gnomes have with architecture and construction leads them to deliberately seek out the Citadel at the end of their lives, so that they can continue their quests.</p>
            <p class="indent">Halfling statuesque are rare, as their light-hearted nature does not lend easily to the ideals of the Citadel. Those few awakened statuesque are deeply affected by the many stories told of their originators, leading to them being perfect copies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Half-orc statuesque are incredibly rare, second only to tieflings in rarity. They are seen as enigmatic by their kin, who admire them for their physical prowess but view their inherently preservative instincts as unusual. Awakened statuesque are even more rare, but struggle due to their appearance as heroes of old, as suspicions over their nature often arise.</p>
            <p class="indent">Human statuesque are very common, second only to dwarves. Their short lifespans and propensity for creating monuments to heroes lead to many statuesque of both varieties being created. Their cultural views vary wildly, but most are relatively understanding and favorable.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tiefling statuesque of either variety are the most rare of all, as their fiendish blood and longer lifespans makes them outcasts and pariahs of most societies. Their horns often trail radiant light and many have bodies comprised of multiple substances or types of stone, making them appear almost angelic yet strangely material as the same time.</p>
            <h4>STATUESQUE TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a statuesque, you are both durable and wise with flesh of stone, hair of metal, and eyes of radiant gold. Despite this, your constitution is quite similar to that of a living mortal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b> Choose either Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma. That ability score increases by two, while the other scores increase by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>Statuesque live for thousands of years and are renewed in the light of the Citadel. None have ever died from old age.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most statuesque tend to be lawful or neutral good. Their heroic nature is often what attracts the Citadel to them, but not all statuesque are great heroes. Some are cruel and evil, seeking preservation without regard to consequences.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Radiant Blessing. </i></b>You gain resistance to radiant damage. If you would also gain this resistance from a class feature, your inner power awakens, granting you the ability to cast the mending cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Timeless Mind. </i></b>You have proficiency in the History skill.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Soul. </i></b>Your form is incredibly durable, thanks to your immortal composition. Whenever you take damage, you can choose to reduce the damage taken by 1. This reduction is applied after resistances or vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Statuesque are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
