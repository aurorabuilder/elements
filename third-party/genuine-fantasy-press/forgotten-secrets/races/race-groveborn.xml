        <description>
            <p>Those who make pacts with the Blackthorn Grove are hardy individuals who travel easily out into the world, so it is unsurprising that they would find love and have children. Those children, however, are rarely untouched by the effects of the Blackthorn heart. Extreme emotion comes easily to these progeny, and as they age their true nature becomes clear. They are known as Groveborn, for their lineage is forever marked by this unnatural power.</p>
            <h4>LIFE RENEWED</h4>
            <p>Not all who go to the Grove do so with mindless apathy. Some have cultured a perfect disdain for life and have washed any cares away like tears in the rain. These individuals are hopeless by choice, nihilists all, and they seek the Grove as a means to fully embrace that void. They do not seek to offer their hearts and receive new ones filled with life. They seek to offer their hearts as a means to die and be gone forever. The Blackthorn accepts these individuals, rare as they may be, and instead of granting them a heart filled with life and purpose, they are instead taken fully into the Blackthorn. Years pass as they are shaped and regrown into something new, filled with the memories and former passions of those whose blood was drained entirely within the Maze. When they emerge from the Grove, they are different people entirely, driven by the total desire of the hundreds of supplicants who died on their way to the heart of the Grove, slain because of their inability to let go of what they truly felt inside.</p>
            <h4>BORN OF THORN</h4>
            <p>Groveborn are relatively uncommon among all races, simply because so few are drawn into the clutches of the Blackthorn. Among those individuals, it is rare for them to survive, and then they must subsequently live through their new adventures. Because of this rarity and their plantlike appearance, groveborn are often mistaken for dryads or other creatures who arise from the verdant landscape. Speaking with one, however, often casts suspicion on that idea. The vast majority are intense individuals, driven with almost blind purpose towards their chosen pursuits. They love as quickly as they hate, and they fight with a fervor one would not expect to find in a race of plant-folk.</p>
            <h4>VARIETY IN APPEARANCE</h4>
            <p>Most groveborn are clearly inhuman, having hair of vines or leaves, skin that appears textured like bark, and occasionally having foliage growing directly from their bodies. They have limited control over this growth, enabling them to form simple clothing with time and focus. Most are surprisingly colorful, having blood red markings upon their bodies, while green leaves sprout from their chests and blue accents flow underneath their skin. Not all follow this color scheme. Some have deep black skin or purple markings, as an individual’s color pattern is most influenced by one’s original demeanor and appearance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dragonborn affected by this change appear to have their scales replaced by bark and have horns similar to tree branches that grow and spread into colorful headdresses. Those who breathe fire tend to seem as though they are constantly smoking, burning from the inside out despite their otherwise calm appearance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dwarven groveborn often have beards of thick moss or other foliage instead of their normal hair and will have skin like the roots of an ancient tree. They are viewed with suspicion by dwarven culture and are shunned in most communities.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elvish groveborn are the most normal-seeming of their kind, though they behave quite a bit more impulsively than other elves. Their verdant hair and colorful skin is quite reminiscent of certain elven groups, though their curious strength differs from their kin.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gnomish groveborn often are mistaken for forest gnomes and thus are able to blend easily into gnomish society. Their passions make them paragons of their communities quite frequently, and they make for fierce adventurers. </p>
            <p class="indent">Halfling groveborn are uncommon and are often mistaken for forest spirits of various kinds. Their shining eyes and striking features make them seem even more otherworldly. Half-orc groveborn have large thorns instead of tusks, giving them an unusually primal appearance. Orcs rarely accept their strange appearance, but their extreme demeanor fits well with many orcish customs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Human groveborn show a wide variety of appearances. Those who are affected the most subtly simply have hair of leaves, while those who are strongly influenced have thorns instead of teeth, small horns of wood, and skin the color of living vines. Those who pursue the more primal arts tend to become druids or rangers, while many more embrace the eldritch power that lies within their bloodline.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tiefling groveborn, or “leaflings” as they are called by scholars, are a strange breed, fully taken by the power of the Blackthorn. All of them have skin that appears to be vines or wood merged into a single unified mass. Horns of wood sprout from their heads, glowing with ethereal light or eldritch power. Their bodies are often covered by outfits grown entirely from their own leaves, and their fingers appear as grasping branches tipped with sharp thorns. They are unquestionably the most colorful, with deep reds mixing with their normally green hue, and while they may be beautiful, it is a harsh beauty that rarely appears welcoming to mortals.</p>
            <h4>GROVEBORN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a groveborn, your connection to the natural world is only marred by the eldritch power in your verdant body. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b> Choose either Strength or Wisdom. That ability score increases by two, while the other score increases by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of a groveborn is twice that of their origin race, thanks to the blessing of the Grove.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most groveborn are neutral, driven by singular passions but still bound by their own morality. Those who fully embrace their nature have little respect for law and may trend towards a chaotic alignment.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Durable Mind. </i></b>You gain resistance to psychic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Guise of the Grove. </i></b>You can take the Hide action to conceal yourself even when you are only lightly obscured so long as you are concealed by plants, such as trees, bushes, or tall grass. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Natural Soul. </i></b>You gain proficiency in the Nature skill.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Sundrinker.</i></b>If you are exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour, you do not need food or water for the day. You can drink the blood of other creatures in place of eating or drinking without ill effect, and the blood of a single Small creature will sustain you for one day. A Medium creature could sustain you for three days, while a Large creature’s entire supply of blood could sustain you for one week or more.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Groveborn are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
