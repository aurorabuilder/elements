        <description>
            <p>Countless worlds have fallen to the Endless Empire. Worlds beyond number lie subservient at the feet of the Empress, and her eyes are everywhere. Every single serpent lends its flickering tongue to her ear, whispering of the things they see and the treasons they encourage. The Empress delights in traitors, as they offer opportunities for punishment, but she also values loyal servitude. Those who are born within the lands ruled by the Empress are imperials, and those who fully subject themselves to her will are similarly regarded.</p>
            <h4>BORN OF SCALE</h4>
            <p>There are few responses beyond the horror that a mother will feel when looking upon their child and seeing them bear the face of an oppressor, even when conceived with one they love. The Empressâ€™s eldritch influence is pervasive and subtle, seeping into the souls of her subjects as they sleep within her dominion. Such power taints the essence of the unborn, warping their bodies and minds. There are few imperials to whom kindness and benevolence comes naturally, as most are selfish, scheming, and sinful. The corruption they are exposed to causes their bodies to change, becoming serpentine in subtle ways at first. Small, semi-transparent scales form over their skin, usually only visible on large open parts of their skin or the edges of the face. Their teeth become fanged and their tongues narrow into serpentine imitations, flickering out to taste for scents. Their hair is replaced with long thin feathers, and their eyes become slitted and glow with an unearthly light.</p>
            <h4>SERVANTS AND SLAVES</h4>
            <p>The imperials are known for their devotion to the Empress, but they are naturally predisposed to betrayal and deception. Schemers and liars, their culture is hierarchical, with countless layers standing between the lowliest of their number and the imperial court. They thrive on injustice. Those who show proper subservience are often slain for being too cunning, while those who rebel are killed for their insolence. Instead, the imperial castes are determined by endless political maneuvering and magical oaths of loyalty. When an imperial swears an oath, they are bound to it until released by the one who accepted their oath. Their first words are often oaths to the Empress, but not always. Some who manage to flee to the worlds beyond her current grasp make use of their ability to change their skin, concealing themselves among the populace of their new home. Others use this to infiltrate and undermine, casting rumors and suspicion.</p>
            <h4>SERPENTINE LINEAGE</h4>
            <p>Imperial dragonborn are common, usually green, and are spectacularly serpentine. Their horns often are replaced with the scaled hood of a cobra</p>
            <p class="indent">Imperial dwarves are rare, and they are hated by their kin for their treacherous ways and feathery beards.</p>
            <p class="indent">Imperial elves are even more reptilian than most, with small claws in place of their nails. Their sibilant poetry conceals their usual malice. </p>
            <p class="indent">Imperial halflings are looked down upon by the other races of the empire, though they are known for their charm.</p>
            <p class="indent">Human and half-orc imperials are among the most common, rarely deviating from the typical appearance. </p>
            <p class="indent">Imperial tieflings are truly serpentine, with colorful scales across their entire bodies and horns like those of a dragon. </p>
            <h4>IMPERIAL TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As an imperial, the corruption of them Empress empowers you even as it twists your will to her demands.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>  Choose either Dexterity or Wisdom. That ability score increases by two, while the other score increases by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of an Imperial is unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most imperials tend to be lawful or evil, bound by hierarchy but jealous of those above them.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision. </i></b>With serpentine eyes, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you gain Darkvision from your racial origin, add both values together. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Forked Tongue. </i></b>You can add your Wisdom modifier to Deception checks in place of your Charisma modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Form Suppression. </i></b>You can conceal your serpentine traits as an action by focusing your will, as though you were maintaining concentration on a spell.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Viper Fangs. </i></b>You can choose to have your unarmed strikes deal poison damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Venomous Blessing. </i></b>You gain resistance to poison damage. If you would also gain this resistance from a class feature, your inner power awakens, granting you the ability to cast the poison spray cantrip. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Imperial are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
