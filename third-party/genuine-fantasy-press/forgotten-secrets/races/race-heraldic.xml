        <description>
            <p>The Storm Lord travels between the countless worlds of the cosmos, gathering the souls of heroes as it goes. These souls are immersed in the radiant power of the storm for eternity, but they do not always stay in the Lord’s kingdom forever. Some are given a new purpose and travel down from the storm to be born anew to parents of a mortal race. </p>
            <p class="indent">Upon their birth, they quickly recall much of their previous lives, though not all of them are so blessed. Those that do remember or have their nature reawakened begin to manifest a strange and mighty power caused by their soul’s former state as a wraith of thunder and lightning. </p>
            <p class="indent">These individuals are often called “heraldic” by those who study such things, for the appearance of a heraldic child indicates that a great conflict shall begin within their lifetime.</p>
            <h4>CONSUMED BY THE STORM</h4>
            <p>The Heraldic are champions of the mortal races from the first moment of their lives, for they are the reincarnations of heroes who entered the embrace the Storm Lord as they died. </p>
            <p class="indent">These champions are nearly countless in number, for the Storm Lord’s collection has spanned the endless worlds for untold centuries. Those whom it collects exist in a strange paradise of thunder and lightning, conflict and peace. </p>
            <p class="indent">Eventually, they begin to forget themselves, becoming restless and purposeless as they struggle with their inability to pass to a higher plane, merely continuing to exist within the Storm Lord’s kingdom in the sky. </p>
            <p class="indent">Those souls who forget all but their names and fragments of their former lives become violent and wrathful, yelling in a booming voice that some call thunder while striking out in arcs of radiant light.</p>
            <h4>BLESSED BY THE STORM</h4>
            <p>Upon these days, when the sky is black and the winds are still, the lightning that crashes to the ground hungers for purpose and life. A champion’s soul carried within it may inhabit a child yet unborn or strike a living mortal, causing the champion to replace them upon the earth. If they are born to parents, they will know only their name, and speak it with a thunderous voice upon their birth. Flashes of memory from their former lives may plague them as they grow, only becoming fully apparent when they experience the full wrath of a great tempest or engage in a deadly battle. Those who have taken the place of another mortal are more conscious and remember their past from the beginning, though often know little of what has happened after their death. </p>
            <p class="indent">Once a heraldic understands their true nature, their soul will ignite for the first time within their body, causing wings of mist and lightning to appear at their back to carry them toward the kingdom in the sky that they once called home. </p>
            <p class="indent">Only true heroes will survive this experience, for the Storm Lord’s powerful blessings are as merciless as a hurricane. As the heraldic grows more powerful, they become better able to withstand the strain of allowing their soul to manifest in such a way, though it is never a comfortable experience. </p>
            <h4>SCARRED BY THE STORM</h4>
            <p>Heraldic individuals often appear surprisingly ordinary at first glance. One of the subtlest signs is the unconscious control their emotions have on the air directly around them. An enraged heraldic will appear to be lashed by a tempest, while a calm one would seem to exist in the serene eye of their own personal storm. Many have eyes of gold, silver, gray, or blue, disregarding their original race. The more powerful heraldic often appear to have thunderheads sparking in their irises. Individuals who were exchanged, rather than born, will commonly have a scar somewhere upon their bodies from where the lightning struck them, and it will glow with otherworldly light when underneath a stormy sky.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many heraldic have hair of white, gold, or clouded gray, and often prefer to wear it long so that it whips about in the air currents that constantly surround them. Some heraldic are fond of elaborate tattoos that detail their feats and the legends of their pasts, so that they will never forget them again.</p>
            <p class="indent">The single most striking visual feature of the heraldic is not always visible, but when it is seen it can’t go unnoticed. The heraldic possess the ability to ignite their own souls in radiant power, causing them to expand beyond their bodies. This ignition manifests as wings of smooth mist and crackling lightning that spread behind the heraldic, causing them to appear as avenging angels of the storm. Some of these wings are like poorly defined cloaks, but others are crisp and visible as the wings of birds, bats, dragons or insects. Some will appear as long streamers of light, spiraling in a constant flow of eldritch power. Regardless of the appearance of these wings, they are always awesome to behold and carry the heraldic forth into the sky like a dancer upon the breeze.</p>
            <h4>HEROES REBORN</h4>
            <p>Heraldic dragonborn are surprisingly common, though usually their breath is of lightning and their heritage is of the blue, brass, or adamantine draconic lineages when they are born. Among their kind, they are viewed with reverence, though only so long as they prove themselves to be the heroes they claim to be.</p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic dwarves are incredibly rare, mostly because so few are consistently present above ground. They possess silver beards and hair long before their age would begin to show, leading to confusion among other dwarves who might expect them to be elders. They are often viewed with suspicion because of this and because of their propensity for flight, which is not a dwarvish trait in the slightest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic elves are common and blend easily within their communities. As a long-lived race, it is entirely possible to meet an old friend who perished in battle, now reborn as a heraldic. Those heraldic elves who were formerly of other races may experience some disconnect from elven culture, being more brash and hasty than the typical elf and are thus well-suited to the adventuring lifestyle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic gnomes are quite rare, and typically appear more frequently in lands where gnomes dwell in the forests and fields. Their large and striking eyes often earn them unusual titles, and many become treasured historians and researchers. </p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic halflings are occasionally called cherubs, though such a statement is often considered impolite. Their features tend to make them stand out among others of their kind, as their unusual eyes and hair will make them the subject of many jokes in more traditional halfling communities.</p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic humans and half-orcs are the most common, as the frequent wars that these races engage in lead to many moments of potential heroism for the Storm Lord to enjoy. Most possess stormscars of some kind, even if born naturally, and these scars will shine with radiant light when exposed to rain. Their wings have the most variation of any racial group, occasionally appearing as sigils of light instead of a facsimile of natural limbs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Heraldic tieflings are the rare few that show traits that are present upon the Storm Lord. Many have blue skin or scales, horns that appear like the Storm Lord’s eerie maw, or bodies that crackle with electricity whenever they are standing in the rain. Almost all these tieflings will possess long, sinuous tails, and many will have reptilian claws instead of hooves upon their feet.</p>
            <h4>FATED FOR GLORY</h4>
            <p>Heraldic individuals are doomed to die glorious deaths. Every culture recognizes them as harbingers of conflict and change, so their arrival often sparks tensions and fear. Long-lived races such as elves will care far less, for an elven heraldic could mean a war will begin in several centuries, but a human heraldic portends a clash of steel is soon to begin.</p>
            <p class="indent">As reborn heroes, heraldic are instinctively drawn to power and conflict. Those who try to resist are often swept along by fate, discovering ancient magics within their bloodline or taking to the sword and bow with an ease brought upon by their ancient experiences. Many accept their fates as harbingers and call to the Storm Lord for guidance, forging new pacts with the great ruler or singing songs of its coming.</p>
            <h4>HERALDIC TRAITS</h4>
