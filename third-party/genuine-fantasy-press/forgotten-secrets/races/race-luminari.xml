        <description>
            <p>There are countless stars in the heavens above, each more distant and alien than the last. In their celestial dance, they shift and move in tune with cosmic energies often beyond the understanding of the mortal races. These cosmic shifts arrange them into constellations, which channel their power toward inscrutable ends. The stars are ancient, wise, and incredibly powerful. Filled with eldritch energy that gives them sentience that is seemingly incomprehensible to the minds of mortals, these stars are not without their blessings. It is from this power that the luminari are born: individuals touched by the light of the cosmic fire at the heart of the universe.</p>
            <h4>BORN TO THE FLAME</h4>
            <p>If a child is born when the stars are in perfect alignment, the soul of the child becomes inherently attuned to the constellations of the sky that watch over their race. The cosmic fire fuses with their essence, marking their flesh with a series of stars. These are typically innocuous, appearing as scars, discolorations, or intricate tattoos and can be anywhere on their bodies. These children are innately gifted with magical power and are cunning, wise, and charismatic. Whenever they cast spells, their starmarks flare and spark, lending the celestial energies of the stars above to the power of their spellcasting.</p>
            <h4>STOLEN ARCANA</h4>
            <p>Individuals who swear themselves to the doomed quest of the Fallen Exile are gifted with the ability to steal power from the stars. Some of them overindulge, drawing more than their frail mortal bodies can withstand. The experience is incredibly painful, tearing away at the flesh as the soul is stretched beyond its normal limitations. Experiences from the past are seared away and the body is sapped of strength while power pours into the warlock. The starmarks upon their skin are far more intense, covering most of their bodies in scars, tattoos, or intricate script resembling their racial stars.</p>
            <h4>BLESSED BY FATE</h4>
            <p>The influence of the celestial spheres is subtle in most cases. The flowing space between time is manipulated by these eldritch beings, causing it to shift gently into a new pattern. The consequences are small: the ice melts just a little faster than it should, the torch takes a moment longer to dim than it might have, the poison seems to kick in just a hair later than it was supposed to. However, every single tiny change matters in the grand scheme of things. </p>
            <p class="indent">The ice breaks just below the foot of the brave adventurer, soaking their boot, forcing them to stop early to warm themselves and delaying their long trek by one crucial hour. The dying torch reveals the hidden switch that opens the exit just moments before sputtering out. The guard manages to raise the alarm before falling to the ground, foaming at the mouth. Each subtle touch shifts events in a new direction, and the minuscule adjustments the stars make are within the grasp of the luminari, thanks to their attunement to these constellations.</p>
            <h4>SIGNS OF THE STARS</h4>
            <p>Each race is blessed by a different collection of stars, as all are manipulated with different ends in mind. Most of these blessings appear to be contrary to the norm for their race, causing these individuals to often be viewed with disdain by their society. Still, the power granted to the luminari affords them with the opportunity to write their own destinies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dragonborn luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Slayer, which often appears as a weapon surrounded by fire in complex marks or a line of stars in simple ones.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dwarven luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Wanderer, which appears as a road winding away from a mountain in more complex marks or a triangle bisected by a line in simple ones.</p>
            <p class="indent">Elven luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Devourer, which appears as a fanged maw or a spiral of scarred blades.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gnomish luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Skulker, which appears as a shrouded figure in more complex marks and as a curved arc of stars in simple ones.</p>
            <p class="indent">Halfling luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Champion, which appears as a shield or helm, though it may be a simple square or bent line in scarred designs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Half-orc luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Scholar, which appears as a book, scroll, or tome.</p>
            <p class="indent">Human luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Heartless, which appears as an open hole centered on the chest with a line pointing towards the person’s dominant arm.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tiefling luminari are marked by the Constellation of the Overseer, which commonly appears as a series of inscriptions shaped into an eye. Most have dozens of these eyes across the prime points of their body, giving them an eerie appearance. </p>
            <h4>LUMINARI TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a luminari, your starmark grants you magical abilities tied to your racial origin.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of a luminari is unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most luminari tend to be different from others of their kind, making them outcasts and rebels. Some are chaotic and cruel, but others are lawful or benevolent.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>Constellation. </i></b>You have been marked by a particular constellation and gain a benefit based on your racial origin that applies whenever you cast a cantrip as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Luminari are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
