        <description>
            <p>The Convocation is known for being transformative and life changing, as even a single glimpse of their true power can leave the most stalwart filled with a fragment of their joy and cheer. There’s a certain simplicity to being an ooze that most mortals simply can’t understand, and yet it calls to them nevertheless. </p>
            <p class="indent">Those who travel far and wide seeking the Convocation may find themselves changed by it without ever encountering it in person. At some point, however, it will finally touch the supplicant with its infinite wiggly appendages, changing them fully into the slime that they have desired to become. Thus, the oozians are created, reborn from the slime beyond.</p>
            <h4>SAVED FROM TRAGEDY</h4>
            <p>Not all oozians are seekers of the Convocation. Others are survivors, stored within crystalline cubes from lost civilizations and re-awoken at the proper moment. The Convocation will approach a city that is destined to fall to war, starvation, or natural disaster, and offer a bargain to them. The citizens of the city will be consumed by the slime, have their memories processed and cataloged, and their souls and minds will be stored within massive crystalline cubes within hidden vaults. </p>
            <p class="indent">After a sufficient time has passed, the Convocation will take actions that lead to the discovery of the vault, and the new oozians will be freed from the crystal and reborn into bodies that are imitations of their previous forms.</p>
            <h4>SLIPPERY SENSE OF SELF</h4>
            <p>The process of being stuck inside a cube with thousands of other minds, while painful at first, eventually leads to understanding, agreement, and harmony among the slimes. Thus, when they are freed, they immediately begin to act in concert toward the goal that they have agreed upon. Unfortunately for their former oppressors, this usually involves taking revenge upon those that wronged them. An army of mentally-trained, Convocation-blessed soldiers who act with one purpose is nearly unstoppable, as many worlds have discovered, and it allows the Convocation to harvest memories from two groups: those who made the deal, and those who died to them.</p>
            <h4>SLIME-FOLK</h4>
            <p>The oozians are fairly simple to describe, though a description of their appearance does not truly do them justice. Oozians appear to be people: ordinary, run-of-the-mill humans, elves, dwarves, even tieflings and dragonborn, except they’re made entirely from colorful, semi-transparent slime. The majority of them are a lime green color, but reds, blues, purples, yellows, and even rainbow-colored slimes are not uncommon. Some shift in hue according to their emotions, while others are very singular in tone. A rare few appear to be more exotic in appearance, looking to be made of quicksilver, liquid gold, black oil, or even blood. </p>
            <h4>CHEERFUL WANDERERS</h4>
            <p>Oozians are most famous for one trait in particular, and this fame is certainly well earned: they are all cheerful. All the time. No doubts. No questions. Cheerful.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most other races find this both charming and incredibly distressing. Those with oozian friends often refer to them as pleasant, but also eerie and disconcerting on unexpected occasions. Oozians are just as likely to laugh at a good joke as they are to chuckle at a friend’s graveside, much to the concern of those around them. Their thoughts on death are fairly simple for the most part: everyone who dies will have their memories preserved within the Convocation, so there’s no point in mourning them unless their bodies are unrecoverable. Even when they are sad, they instinctively look on the brighter side of life.</p>
            <h4>ETERNAL OPTIMISIM</h4>
            <p>The oozian propensity for cheer and good humor also extends to their outlook on everything. They are surprisingly durable and difficult to kill by most standards, so they do not shirk from danger or deadly adventures. While they enjoy the company of others, especially fellow oozians, they are perfectly willing to wander out alone into the world whenever the desire strikes them. </p>
            <p class="indent">They are fairly passionate people and will speak up in defense of their friends or turn scornful toward their enemies without a moment’s notice. While not all are quite so vocal, their stubborn drive to act rarely has them sitting on the sidelines of life. </p>
            <p class="indent">When they are among other oozians, they become wild and expressive, sharing stories and experiences freely amongst themselves. While they are friendly towards other races, few can really understand the joys of the Convocation without having experienced it for themselves.</p>
            <h4>OPEN TO LIFE</h4>
            <p>The one thing that all oozians crave more than anything else are new experiences. They can rarely stand performing repetitive tasks, unless there is something new to be learned or mastered. Oozian smiths are some of the most famed of the Alfallen, second only to the ashenspawn. While the fiery ones work with metal alone, the oozians are famed for their slime-smithing, where they take crystallized ooze and work it into new shapes brimming with magical power. Other oozian craftspeople perform feats of incredible skill, always seeking to create something unique and innovative. </p>
            <p class="indent">Many oozian sculptors and artists take special joy in subverting expectations, creating dozens of identical works. The trick, they will tell you, is that, despite the appearances of these copies, each one is comprised of different materials and different techniques carefully discovered and applied so that the finished products appear to be the same, but the experiences that created them are entirely different. </p>
            <h4>OOZIAN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As an oozian, your body is both durable and flexible, as befits a slime blessed by the Convocation.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b> Choose either Constitution or Dexterity. That ability score increases by two, while the other score increases by one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age. </i></b>The lifespan of an oozian is unchanged.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most oozians tend to be good or chaotic, as they are a kind but passionate people.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size. </i></b>Your size is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed. </i></b>Your speed is determined by your origin race.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Acidic Body. </i></b>You gain resistance to acid damage. If you would also gain this resistance from a class feature, your inner power awakens, granting you the ability to cast the acid splash cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip. You are immune to acid damage caused by friendly oozes. </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Jiggly Self. </i></b>You have resistance to falling damage, and you are not knocked prone when you take falling damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Limitless Cheer. </i></b>You can add your Charisma modifier to saving throws against being frightened.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages. </i></b> Oozian are fluent in Common and in the language of their racial origin.</p>
