        <description>
            <p>Sleep does not come easily to everyone, especially those who are plagued by nightmares. These individuals are often drawn from sleep, screaming in terror and fear due to the devastating visions that haunt them at the midnight hour. The Shadowcat, the First Nightmare that seeks to consume and convert other all other nightmares into a reflection of itself, takes special interest in people who suffer in this way and may pay them a visit as they stare silently into the darkness. Tiredness lulling their eyes to close, they fight to stay awake for fear of what this night will bring. The soft and terrible voice of the Shadowcat will whisper into the ears of those marked, night after night, feeding on the nightmares that come for them and keeping them safe from harm.</p>
            <h4>GAURDED BY DARKNESS</h4>
            <p>This protection does not come without a cost. Individuals will find themselves changing gradually by the influence of the Shadowcat, for they are both entertainment and a delightful feast to the Shadowcat and its infinite army of reflections. Each night, they shall find themselves growing less comforted by sleep, their reflexes quickening even as their eyes open to the mysteries of the unspoken dark. These individuals are known as the nocturne, for their insomnia is not cured by their caretaker. The dark power of the Shadowcat will seep ever deeper into their soul, causing their eyes to become catlike and their ears to shift to a more feline form. Wisps of blue light will flow gently from their irises as they stalk the night, hoping and fearing for the dawn.</p>
            <h4>THE DREAMLESS WATCHERS</h4>
            <p>The Shadowcat is powerful beyond measure, but the Inverse is more a universe than a kingdom. Nightmares spawn within wherever they can take root, growing and festering and appearing in countless forms. The Shadowcat hunts for these terrors, but another always appears wherever a mortal mind languishes in fear. Jesters with bleeding eyes cavort and dance alongside fiendish spiders and disgusting, consuming, unstoppable slimes. Stairs become gateways to the darkness of terror below, and cliffs lead to terrible falls that seem unending yet ever-perilous. Every doorway has a monster behind it, waiting to be let loose, and every meal is filled with maggots and human bones. Hags and witches cackle in every woodland cabin, werewolves howl beneath the moon, and undead claw forth from their graves wearing the faces of loved ones in the Inverse. It is a land built from fear, where lightness is pitch black and darkness is pale white. It is the land that the nocturne visit in their sleep, and it is here that they watch and listen. The nocturne do not dream anymore. They witness.</p>
            <h4>BORN OF SHADE</h4>
            <p>The nocturne are often children who have been born to parents who have made pacts with the Shadowcat, as its influence often bleeds into the bloodline of these individuals. These changes rarely go unnoticed, but as children are especially precious to the Shadowcat, it will send a strong reflection of itself to protect the child until it comes of age. Individuals who make pacts with the Shadowcat are opened to its influence and may also become nocturne because of their pacts. When this happens, the process is far faster, and completes in full when they gain their eldritch powers from the Shadowcat.</p>
            <h4>PALE EYES</h4>
            <p>Nocturne are often subtle in their changes, but their eyes will almost always give them away. They are universally a deep and intoxicating shade of blue, and in the dark, wisps of teal mist will seem to shimmer from the corners of their eyes. They can suppress this effect with practice, and even conceal the glow of their eyes, but rarely choose to do so. Their hair is dark and thick, like the ebony fur of their patron, and their ears rise catlike above their hair. Their canine teeth are especially prominent, giving them an almost vampiric cast that is unquestionably feline upon closer inspection.</p>
            <p class="indent">The eyes of a nocturne are their most striking feature, and the one for which they are best known. Many tales are told of their legendary sight, picking out color even in the darkest of shadow as though standing in daylight. The more frightening stories report that they can see into the darkest fears of others and can make them real. These are often exaggeration or misattribution, as the nocturne are far too concerned with the nightmares they are still plagued with to bother with the dread of others. While their connection to the Shadowcat grants them a measure of protection against the suffering that comes from a lack of rest, the allure of their unique souls causes nightmares to enter their dreams constantly. Each night, the nocturne must decide – sleep and suffer the consequences upon their mind, or stay awake and lose their feline edge. Most settle into a pattern, sleeping as little as they can in order to retain their sanity, but those who are warriors or practice the sorcerous arts are often not granted that luxury, instead awakening with power and energy even as dread eats gently at the corners of their minds.</p>
            <h4>UMBRAL LINEAGE</h4>
            <p>The Shadowcat’s mark often appears upon humans, halflings, and gnomes, who are more prone to fear in the darkened hours. However, nocturne of all races have appeared at least once. Even elves, who normally do not sleep as the other races do, are not immune to nightmares coming forth during their trance if they have witnessed horrors in their lives or suffered fear during their waking hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne dragonborn are exceptionally rare, so much so that they’re often considered mere myths or individuals bearing the heritage of a shadow dragon instead. Their horns are long, jagged, and stream with ribbons of shadow, and they lack the cat ears other nocturne possess. Their fangs are often especially large and are difficult to conceal.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne dwarves are uncommon but not unheard of. They tend to be smaller and less stocky than other dwarves, and their eyes trend towards a purplish hue as opposed to the stark blue of other races. They typically conceal their heritage, though they’re valued as excellent scouts in the dark tunnels of the dwarven lands.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne elves are uncommon, for nightmares have a harder time seeking them in their trance. Still, the Shadowcat takes great pleasure in changing an elf, as their long lives provide a constant and enduring source of nightmares to feast upon. They often possess additional feline traits, such as tails or small claws.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne gnomes are oddly common, despite their racial propensity to withstand and recover from magic that would affect the mind. As a smaller race, gnomes are often victimized by monsters and brigands, sowing a ripe garden within which nightmares may bloom. The Shadowcat enjoys devouring these nightmares, for their shape is pleasing to it, and so it will often whisper in the ears of particularly cowardly gnomes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne halflings are also common, though less so among the braver and stouter members of their race. Their natural luck and affinity for trickery causes them to attract the attention of the Shadowcat whenever they become afflicted in the night, and they often bear claw-like marks upon their skin from where a reflection of the Shadowcat has tasted their famed fortune.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne humans are very common, as are nocturne half-elves, if only by the sheer population of their original race. Vulnerable to the terrors of the night, humans show great variety in how the traits of a nocturne are expressed. Some only bear the classic eyes and ears, while others have fangs, small claws, tails, and even fur along the arms and legs, though more advanced changes are rare.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nocturne tieflings are especially vulnerable to the influence of the Shadowcat and commonly have fur along their entire bodies, and occasionally have faces reminiscent of a cat. Other feline traits are almost assured, and traces of their fiendish heritage rarely remain visible. Very few possess horns or demonic tails but will often have digitigrade legs that place no weight upon the heels, like those of a natural cat.</p>
            <h4>MIXED BLESSING</h4>
            <p>Civilized lands often view individuals who have become nocturne through no fault of their own as troublemakers and tricksters, for they rarely sleep when others do. Some view them with sympathy, treating them as one might an individual suffering from a mental illness. Others are less caring but may speak in hushed whispers about a person with glowing blue eyes that wisp with eerie smoke. Communities of nocturne are viewed poorly by others but have a strong group bond. Knowing others who understand the constant lure and terror of sleep helps many stay sane and whole, despite the troubles in their lives. Few nocturne speak about their forced insomnia to those outside a close circle of friends, as they feel it would put unrequited burden upon strangers.</p>
            <h4>NOCTURE TRAITS</h4>
