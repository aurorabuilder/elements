			<h4>PRESTIGE CLASSES</h4>
			<p>In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in the game. Typically, a prestige class requires you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren’t already possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you. A prestige class uses the normal D&amp;D multiclassing rules (see chapter 6, “Customization Options,” in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>(This Prestige Class offers only 5 levels)</strong></p>
			</center>
			<h4>BECOMING AN ATUM PILOT</h4>
			<p>Pilots are special individuals trained to pilot large vehicular constructs called All Terrain Utility Machines, or ATUMs. These machines can be outfitted with various different hardpoints and upgrades, making the ATUM one of the most versatile vehicles an individual can have the luxury of calling their own. From gigantic walking trade caravans to packs of smaller constructs bristling with vicious missile launchers and deadly close combat weapons, ATUMs are used for many different scenarios, and pilots are widely sought after for contracts or bounties.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though many individuals are capable of controlling an ATUM’s basic utilities, only a few accomplished operators have the talent to unlock the true capabilities these advanced machines are capable of. Many aspiring Nomads choose the academic route; advancing through their regional ATUM Academy before then obtaining a licence to construct basic civilian class category 1 ATUMs, usually for trade purposes or travel. Others join the military, choosing to obtain their skills through combat training and emerging on the other side grizzled veterans; their piloting skills perfected after many years of intense conflict. Particularly ambitious individuals - especially ones who aren’t fond of the law - tend to introduce themselves to the pilot life by building an ATUM from scratch in a backwater town or workshop. These pilots shirk the academies and militaristic routes in favor of a more dangerous path, filled with independance, experimentation, adventure, and freedom at the cost of academic support and government contracts.</p>
			<h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>
			<p>In order to advance in the ATUM pilot prestige class, you must meet the following prerequisites (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Dexterity 13.</b> ATUM pilots need agile fingers and quick reactions to master the speed and mobility of such large machines.</li>
				<li><b>Intelligence 13.</b> Piloting an ATUM is not a simple task. Pilots must be quick thinking and have a comprehensive knowledge of the complex inner workings of an ATUM to be able to use one effectively.</li>
				<li><b>Character level 5th.</b> Before you can begin the studies and practices of an ATUM pilot, you must first prove you are capable of remaining level-headed and surviving in various, potentially dangerous, situations. You must be a 5th-level character before you can gain levels in the ATUM pilot prestige class.</li>
				<li><b>Proficiency with Vehicles.</b> ATUMs are a special class of vehicle, but share many similarities with other mechanical constructs. You must be competent with driving vehicles (land) and tinkering with them to begin to understand the complex mechanics of an ATUM.</li>
				<li><b>Access to an ATUM.</b> You must find or build an ATUM of your own, by using a workshop to create one yourself, or purchasing a pre-built ATUM from a passing ATUM trader.</li>
			</ul>
            <h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>

            <p>You are especially talented at repairing, upgrading and modifying ATUMs; both your own, and others. You become far more proficient when effecting field repairs on your ATUM.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you roll hit dice for your ATUM when performing field repairs or patch jobs, the ATUM regains an additional 1d8 hit points per level in this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, once per long rest, when you spend a short rest either working alone, or helping another creature to repair, upgrade or otherwise modify an ATUM, you can grant that ATUM an additional temporary bonus from the list below. An ATUM cannot benefit from more than one bonus at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Quick Fix.</i></b> The ATUM gains temporary hit points equal to 2d4 x your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last for 2d4 hours.</p>

            <p>You are a frontline fighter, specialized in close or mid range ATUM combat. Fearsome and dedicated, your ATUM is a shield and sword you wield with the grace of a dancer and the ferocity of a wolverine, outstepping your opponents in deadly duels or saturating them with overwhelming firepower.</p>
			<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
			<h5>FIGHTING STYLE</h5>
			<p>When piloting an ATUM, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose two fighting styles from the list of optional features. You can’t take the same fighting style option more than once, even if you get to choose again later.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Crack Shot.</i></b> You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged hardpoints.</li>
				<li><b><i>Defender.</i></b> While you are piloting an ATUM, that ATUM gains a +1 bonus to its AC.</li>
				<li><b><i>Heavy Hitter.</i></b> Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee hardpoint attack, you can reroll the hardpoints damage dice and use either total.</li>
				<li><b><i>Quick Strider.</i></b> When piloting an ATUM with the Bipedal or Quadrupedal mobility type, that ATUM’s speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
				<li><b><i>Missile Specialist.</i></b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with ranged hardpoint, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The hardpoint must have the missile property for you to gain this benefit.</li>
				<li><b><i>Plated Combatant.</i></b> When piloting an ATUM, that ATUM’s armour plating damage threshold increases by (10).</li>
				<li><b><i>Ballistics Specialist.</i></b> Once per long rest, you can increase the ammo box value of a ballistic hardpoint you have equipped by 1. The hardpoint retains this bonus for 8 hours, or until it’s operated by any creature other than you.</li>
				<li><b><i>Energy Specialist.</i></b> When you make an attack roll with an energy hardpoint, you can choose to roll an additional d20 and use either result. You can choose to roll the additional die before or after you make the attack roll, but before the outcome of the roll is determined. You regain the use this feature after completing a short rest.</li>

        <description>
            <p>Your understanding of an ATUM’s mobility, hardpoint strength and battlefield flexibility has given you a tactical edge on the battlefield.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain three superiority dice, which are d8s, which you can expend when piloting an ATUM. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you learn two maneuvers from the maneuver list below.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Saving Throws.</i></b> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
			</center>
			<h5>MANEUVERS</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Flanking.</i></b> When you move on your turn, you can expend a superiority die to choose a friendly pilot within 60ft of you who can see or hear you. That pilot can use its reaction to move up to half its speed towards a target of your choice.</li>
				<li><b><i>Pinning Fire.</i></b> When you make an attack roll against a creature or ATUM using a ranged hardpoint or weapon, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to pin it in place. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and if the attack hits, the hardpoint or weapon deals its normal damage, and the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0ft until the end of its next turn.</li>
				<li><b><i>Squad Support.</i></b> >As a bonus action on your turn, you can call on an ally to support you in battle. When you do so, choose a friendly pilot or crew member within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That pilot or crew member can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon or hardpoint attack against a target of your choice, adding the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.</li>
				<li><b><i>Targeting Array.</i></b> As a bonus action on your turn, you can help your allies by target-locking a creature or ATUM - making them more susceptible to missile attacks. Choose one creature within 120 feet of you that you can see and isn’t behind total cover and expend a superiority die. Make a ranged weapon attack against that target, adding the superiority die to the attack roll. On a hit, the target becomes target-locked for all allies within their missile hardpoint range until the end of your next turn, or until the lock is lost as normal.</li>
				<li><b><i>Covering Fire.</i></b> You give covering fire to an ally as they move. As a bonus action, expend one superiority die and choose one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, if an enemy creature makes an attack roll against that ally, you can elect to spend your reaction to take the attack action against it, rolling the superiority die and adding it to any attack rolls you make as part of that action. If you hit, the target takes the weapon of hardpoints normal damage, and has disadvantage on any attack rolls made until the end of their next turn.</li>
				<li><b><i>Draw Fire.</i></b> You distract one creature or ATUM pilot that can see and hear you. As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die to force that creature or pilot to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls that do not target you, and any saving throws a friendly creature other than you makes against it have advantage until the end of your next turn. A creature with an intelligence of 16 or higher has advantage on this save.</li>

A creature or ATUM pilot can only be affected by this feature once per turn. This feature has no effect against creatures that cannot be frightened.</description>

            <p>To further aid you in your travels, you have created (magically or otherwise), a basic artificial intelligence, which you have installed into your ATUM via a small mechanical “brain”.</p>
            <p class="indent">The A.I. understands your spoken commands, but cannot speak. When you are not in the pilot seat, it will allow the ATUM to operate autonomously and pilot in your stead, obeying any command you give it to the best of its ability (no action required by you). It rolls it’s own initiative during combat and acts on its own.</p>
            <p class="indent">When acting autonomously, The A.I. grants the ATUM a Wisdom, Intelligence, Charisma and Dexterity score of 10, and a proficiency bonus of +4. The A.I. functions as simply another piece of the ATUM’s hardware, but has a personality unique to it, having an alignment similar to yours. The AI brain can’t be targeted seperately by attacks outside of the ATUM.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any attack that would target the AI or its brain will instead target the ATUM as a whole, unless originating from inside the cockpit. The brain is a tiny object with an AC of 15, 30 hit points and is resistant to all damage. If the ATUM is destroyed, the A.I. is destroyed as well. You can create a new A.I. by spending 48 hours over the course of 1 week in a workshop and 2,000gp on materials. </p>
            <p class="indent">The ATUM can follow simple or complex commands. For example, you could command it to guard a hallway, navigate from one location to another while you sleep inside the cockpit, pick you up and place you in the pilot’s seat, fight beside you in combat, or even help construct a building, provided it was equipped with appropriate hardpoints.</p>

Grey Wolves view ATUMs as a means to an end, often putting themselves and their constructs through great risk and danger in battle if it means granting them a cleaner kill. Grey Wolves fear little, and the trust in their ATUM skills is unmatched for good reason.</p>
            <p class="indent">Grey Wolves are renown for their fierce loyalty when fighting in groups, and their savage ferocity when fighting alone. Many of these pilots thrive in the midst of battle; putting their skills to use as mercenaries for hire, hunting vast monsters or evasive bounties.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, it is not the money that drives many pilots to a life of a Grey Wolf, but the thrill of the hunt, and the taste of victory at the sight of fleeing, defeated foes.</p>

            <p>You have become a veteran combatant, able to keep your cool under the most pressuring of situations, while inflicting incredible damage with your weapons of choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">While piloting your ATUM, you are immune to being charmed or frightened. If you were charmed or frightened before mounting your ATUM, the effect is supressed until you dismount.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you have advantage on initiative rolls and, once per short rest, if your ATUM would be struck by a critical hit, you can use your reaction to maneuver the ATUM to a more advantageous position, preventing any creatures inside the ATUM from taking the critical hit damage. The ATUM still takes the critical hit damage as normal.</p>

            <p>You have learnt to hit with a striking, stunning force.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you successfully hit a target with an ATUM hardpoint, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">On a success, the target staggers under the force of the blow and is knocked prone. On a failed save, it is also stunned until the end of your next turn. If you target an ATUM with this feature and it fails the save, the 1d3 random creatures inside the ATUM are stunned for the duration instead. You can use this feature 3 times per long rest.</p>

            <p>You have become a master of combat, revelling in the destruction and terror you inflict on your enemies. During a long rest, you can outfit your ATUM with a fearsome display of trophies, kill markings and sigils, ranging from intimidating spikes of scrap welded onto the chassis, to inspirational high-flying banners or a flowing cape displaying your insignia, imitating the look of a knightly order.</p>
            <p class="indent">Choose one of the following appearances for your ATUM below. This appearance lasts until you change it for another one, or remove it during a long rest, and grant a special feature when you pilot your ATUM:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Marauder.</i></b> An enemy creature or ATUM that starts its turn within 20-feet of you and can see your ATUM’s appearance must succeed on a wisdom saving throw versus your ATUM save DC. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, attacks that target make against you have disadvantage, and any damage it deals to your ATUM is reduced by 3. This has no effect on a creature immune to being charmed. In addition, you score a critical hit against that target on the roll of a 19 or 20. If another feature already grants you this increase, such as a fighter’s improved critical, it instead increases this bonus by 1, to a maximum of 17-20.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Commander.</i></b> A friendly creature that is within 30 feet of your ATUM and can see your banners cannot be frightened. If it is already frightened, the effect is suppressed while the creature remains within this range. In addition, if you attack a target, and a friendly creature or ATUM attacks the same target as you before the start of your next turn, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack and damage roll, provided it is within 30 feet of you and can see your banners.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Protector.</i></b> You eminate a defensive aura that radiates out from your ATUM in a 15-foot sphere. Friendly creatures and ATUMs in this radius gain a +2 bonus to their AC. This AC bonus is lost as soon as the ally leaves your aura.</p>
