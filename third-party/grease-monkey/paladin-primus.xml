		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Primus calls to paladins who seek to serve justice and preserve order throughout the material plane and beyond. A creature that swears themselves to this oath isn’t just responsible for upholding justice and order, but also acts as an extension of Primus’s will.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF DEVOTION</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Primus revolve around the destruction of chaos and the maintenance of order and justice. Paladins who uphold these tenets take great pride in the services they perform as divine soldiers of Primus, and pursue those in conflict with these tenets with dogged determination and tenacity.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Obedience.</em></strong> Respect the laws of the land, and do not seek to undermine those following them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroy the Enemies of Order.</em></strong> Those who defy order defy the Primus. Such creatures should be purged, lest their heresy spread.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Justice is Law.</em></strong> Tolerate no dissent, and fuel no corruption. Justice is absolute. You shall serve as an extension of Primus’s will; to be judge, jury and excecutioner in the name of the One and the Prime.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Uproot the Seeds of Chaos.</em></strong> The evils of chaos is a bane that must be purged at every opportunity. Leave no stone unturned and have no mercy when hunting the enemies of order.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sanctified Ammunition.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to magically bless a ranged weapon you are holding, sanctifying its ammunition with holy power for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. For the duration, when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack using this sanctified weapon, you can choose to divine smite with it, expending spell slots as you would a melee weapon attack.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Divine Judgement.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to instill the fear of judgement and order in one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. The frightened creature’s speed becomes 0, it drops whatever it is holding, and must spend it’s action grovelling and begging for mercy. In addition, while a creature is frightened of you in this way, the next weapon attack you make that hits the target is a critical hit. An affected creature remains frightened of you for 1 minute. It ends early if it takes damage, or if you end the effect as a bonus action on your turn</p>
