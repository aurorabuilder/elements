            <p>You have an uncanny ability to reroute an ATUMâ€™s power connectors and structural supports, making module installations fit and upgrades function much more efficiently.</p>
            <p class="indent">When building or modifying an ATUM in a workshop as part of a long rest, you can spend 4 hours optimizing its internal components. When an ATUM is optimized in this way, you grant it one of the following features, shown below.</p>
            <p class="indent">This feature lasts until you change it as part of a long rest, or until the ATUM is reduced to 0 hit points. An ATUM can only benefit from one of these features at a time. If it gains a new feature from this feat, it loses its previous benefit.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Tight Structure.</i></b> The ATUM has +1 module upgrade slot, and can house 1 less crew member.</li>
				<li><b><i>Charge Increase.</i></b> One active upgrade module of your choice gains 1 additional charge.</li>
				<li><b><i>Shock Absorbers.</i></b> The ATUM gains +1 AC, and is resistant to fall damage.</li>
			</ul>

            <p>You are more machine than mortal. Some call you crazy, others call you inspired. Whatever your motivation was, your new parts are certainly a sight to behold.</p>
            <p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a mechanical implant, granting you increased strength, speed, toughness or observational skills. You increase your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution or Wisdom score by 1.</li>
                <li>You become more resilient, gaining a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
            </ul>
			<p>You can choose this feat up to three times, gaining a +1 bonus to your AC each time you choose it, to a maximum of +3.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you choose this feat twice, any type you have is replaced with construct. If you choose it three times, you exchange your original race for the warforged race, changing your racial traits accordingly to match your new form.</p>
