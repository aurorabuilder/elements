			<p>You are a resourceful talent when it comes to finding interested parties willing to do business, and often use this to fund your adventures. When residing in a settlement, you can always find a way to contact your esteemed investors; often through the use of trade representatives in the region. You can request funding, ATUMs, or other equipment for your travels from your investors, though what level of support your investors give you depends on how profitable they feel you can make it for them.</p>
