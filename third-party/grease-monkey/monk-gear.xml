			<p>Monks of the Way of the Gear learn to channel their life energies through mechanical modifications, believing the path to true enlightenment comes from being more machine than mortal. They teach that such modifications, when combined with extreme training and medititation, can unlock the latent abilities, both physical and mental, that lie dormant in all sentient creatures.</p>

			<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you replace one body part, either your hand, arm or leg, with a mechanical prosthesis, which you use to better channel your ki, allowing you to magically harness the power of automation magic through a special discipline style called the Gear Discipline, described below.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Gear discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. You learn a number of automation spells when you first gain this feature, and learn more automation spells as you gain levels in this class. The number of spells you know is listed in the Gear Discipline table below. You can cast these spells at the ki point cost shown in the Spells and Ki Points table, using your mechanical prosthesis as your spellcasting focus, and Wisdom as your spellcasting modifier. See chapter 10 in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the automation spells you know with another automation spell of your choice, abiding by the spell level limit shown in the Gear Discipline table.</p>

			<p>By 6th level, you have mastered the ability of enhancing the effects of spells you can cast through your mechanical augmentation.</p>

The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 6th level monk and you cast <i>iron sphere</i>, you can spend 4 ki points to cast it as a 3rd-level spell (the spell’s base cost of 3 ki points plus 1).</p>
			<p class="indent">The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your Ki Point Limit, as shown in the Gear Discipline table.</p>
