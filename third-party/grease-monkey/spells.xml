		<description>
			<p>Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. Recently, arcane loremasters have discovered a new method of creating magic; one drawn from The One and the Prime itself. This machine-god is the divine ruler of Mechanus, a plane of order, construct and law, and creator of the race of mystical constructs known as the Modrons. Many scholars and students know The One and the Prime simply as Primus. A combination of conjuration and transmutation, this new, ninth school of construct based magic was named automation - a school many ATUM pilots have found invaluable, both on and off the field of battle.</p>
			<h5>The Magic of Construction &amp; Manipulation</h5>
			<p>Automation spellcrafting shares many traits with both conjuration and transmutation schools of magic, granting the caster the ability to alter the properties of objects, or create powerful mechanical defenses from thin air. However, unlike other schools of magic, the strength of the automation school lies within its intrinsic connection to all things mechanical. A wizard of automation can pull apart man-made constructs bolt by bolt, or easily transform iron filings into a magical suit of skin-tight armour. A cleric or paladin drawing upon automation magic can grant themselves or others powerful boons by covering themselves in a barrier of divine gears, or infusing an ally with a sudden burst of speed and resilience.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You meld together a collection of metal scraps, creating a 3-foot long mechanical cannon that hovers within range for the duration, fueled by magical energy. When the mechanical cannon is first constructed, the cannon fires a beam of divine judgement out from it in a direction you choose.</p>
			<p class="indent">The beam is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the cannon up to 20 feet to a spot you can see, or repeat this attack facing the same direction or in a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> The damage increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 7th.</p>

			<p>Choose metal objects or scrap metal not being worn or carried within range that, when amassed together, create a pile no smaller than 10 cubic feet. You weave a mechanical incantation, assembling the metal into a dragon of challenge rating 6 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.

		<supports>Paladin</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Choose a pile of scrap metal no larger than 10 cubic feet. You transform some of that metal into a mechanical steed. The steed appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the scrap pile. The steed takes the form of a large or smaller beast that you choose of challenge rating 1 or lower that doesn’t have a fly or swim speed. The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a construct instead of its normal type, gains a +1 bonus to its AC, and appears clockwork, steampunk or futuristic in design, depending on your setting and the materials used. For example, a mechanical tiger might have long tangled wires as a tail, and an array of long nails or bolts as teeth. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it collapses back into it’s component parts and scrap metal. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing the same effect. In either case, casting this spell again constructs the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p>
			<p class="indent">While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can’t have more than one steed constructed by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to break back down into scrap.</p>

			<p class="indent">Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, it falls under your control and animates for the duration. You can spend a bonus action to command the target using a free hand while you are conscious, which it performs if physically able to without requiring another creature’s input. For example, a stagecoach could roll forwards off a cliff or turn a corner without requiring a horse, while an ATUM could make a weapon attack against a target, or move without a pilot. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attacking a creature, or moving to a particular point. If the target completes the order and doesn’t recieve further direction from you, it remains inert and ummoving until you command it again.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature attempts to pilot the target, that creature can attempt to wrest control of it from you by using its action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends on the target. On a failure, the creature takes 4d10 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.

			<p>You place a magical sigil of mechanus on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out one service or action of your choice for the duration of the spell. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it’s alignment becomes lawful neutral, and it cannot act in a manner that directly violates that alignment. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death, or a command that would directly violate its current alignment. Should you issue such a command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>lesser</i> or <i>greater restoration</i> spell also ends it. If the charmed creature takes damage, it can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, you can target one additional creature.

			<p>Choose a pile of metal or a nonmagical metal object you can see within range no smaller than 5 cubic feet. You rapidly increase it’s temperature, transforming it into a thick, malleable metal that you sling towards one target you can see within 60 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained by the metal and takes 3d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, or the metal cools. On a successful save, the target isn’t affected.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature restrained by this spell must make a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns as the metal begins to cool. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends and the creature breaks free. If it fails saves three times, it is sealed within the cooled metal and subjected to the following effects for the duration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creature, along with any object it is wearing or carrying, is sealed within the metal, and cannot breathe unless there is an opening for air flow. In addition, its weight increases by a factor of ten.</li>
				<li>The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
				<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
				<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
				<li>The creature has Resistance to all damage.</li>
				<li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is unaffected.</li>
			</ul><p>The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire duration, a creature sealed within the metal remains trapped inside until the metal is broken (AC 20, 75hp) or dispelled.</p>

			<p>You touch a creature and weave intricate metallic fibres into the stump of one severed body member (a finger, leg, tail, or limb). That lost body part is replaced with a mechanical prosthesis for the duration of the spell.</p>

It has an AC of 16 and 20 hit points, and counts as a carried nonmagical object for the purposes of any effects that would target it.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the prosthesis is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. It otherwise functions exactly the same as the body member it is replacing. For example, a hand could wield a sword or cast a spell, or a foot could run or be used to perform an unarmed strike.</p>

The original creature’s physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature’s soul is elsewhere.</p>

		<supports>Cleric, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a warding symbol of Primus either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal it (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the symbol can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the symbol is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
			<p class="indent">The symbol is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers this symbol when you cast the spell. For symbols inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on it, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For symbols inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the symbol. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the symbol, such as those who say a certain password. When you inscribe the symbol, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the symbol creaks and spins like the mechanisms of a gear, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with the sound of clockwork mechanism and chimes for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the symbol activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Entrapment.</i></b> Each target wearing metal armour or carrying or touching a metal object must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the metal transforms into long chains that wind around the target, restraining and incapacitating it for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Deafen.</i></b> The chimes increase in volume, creating loud booms that are audible out to 500 feet. Each target that is capable of hearing must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is deafened and knocked prone, and their movement speed is reduced to 10 feet for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Dismantle.</i></b> Each nonmagical object, armour or item carried by a creature falls to pieces for 1 minute. Constructs must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or collapse into their component parts, becoming unconscious for 1 minute, or until all of its parts are removed from the radius.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Paralyzing Storm.</i></b> Lightning springs from the ward, covering the area in jumping sparks of electricity. Each target in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 lightning damage and being paralyzed for 1 minute on a failed save, or half as much damage and no other effects on a successful save.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Devastate.</i></b> All nonmagical metal objects in the area not being worn or carried explode, filling the area with shattered fragments. The area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot area takes 10 minutes to clear by hand. In addition, each target in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Furnace.</i></b> All nonmagical metal objects, including equipment that is being worn or carried in the area becomes white hot to the touch for 1 minute. A target in physical contact with any metal in the area at the start of their turn or during it takes 6d6 fire damage. If a creature is holding or wearing a metal object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn.</p>

			<p class="indent">A target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen construct, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells. The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment, but can wield nonmagical weapons or interact with objects if the new form can do so.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Choose a pile of scrap metal or nonmagical objects containing metal in range. The metal pieces lock together, forming a wall of rotating gears. The wall constructs in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier up to 100 feet long and 10 feet high, or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot rotating gears. Each gear must be contiguous and interlocked in a rotation with another gear. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick. It lasts for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall, dome or sphere is an object made of interlocking metal gears that can be damaged and thus breached. Each gear has an AC 16 and 50 hit points, and provides threequarters cover to creatures behind it. Reducing a gear to 0 hit points destroys it but doesn’t cause connected panels to collapse. Medium or smaller creatures can attempt to climb through the wall, which counts as difficult terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a creature passes through the wall or climbs over it, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage and is restrained by the wall. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t restrained. A creature restrained by the wall can attempt a Strength (Athletics) check versus your spell save DC at the end of its turn. On a success, it is no longer restrained by the wall. On a failure, the creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You transform a square foot of steel into a non-magical wall of solid steel 4 inches thick, composed of ten 10-foot-by-10- foot panels. If the wall cuts through a creatures space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical, or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements and so on.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has an AC of 20 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion. If successfully cast, the wall is permanent and cannot be dispelled.</p>

			<p>You throw up a set of circular saw blades, which hover and spin in place for a moment before catapulting out towards a point you choose within range, filling the area around that point in a 5 foot cube.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the circular saws must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. As a bonus action, you can move the blades up to 30 feet in any direction.</p>
