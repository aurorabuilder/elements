			<p>You grew up in workshops; maintaining, supporting and outfitting ATUMs to earn a living. You’ve witnessed the creation of colossal, military class ATUMs, endured chilling winds and snow while repairing light civilian transports trapped atop rural mountains, and spent weeks at a time working in quiet solitude, with only your tools for company.</p>

				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Persuasion</li>

			<p>You are a talented mechanic, and can offer to help repair something for those in need in exchange for information or a place for you and your companions to stay for the night. Often this can involve fixing a leaking sink in a tavern, or repairing an ATUM that has broken down on the roadside. When strangers recognize you in a town where you performed a particularly helpful good deed, they typically take a liking to you.</p>
