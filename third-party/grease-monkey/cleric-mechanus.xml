			<p>Some clerics find themselves drawn to the interweaving mechanical mechanisms of machinery, seeing it as a blessing of advancement and protection they should gift to the world. Through divine prayer and worship of such creations, these clerics draw their divine strength from Mechanus, a cog - driven, divine plane of constructs.</p>
			<p>Clerics of Mechanus often follow a rigid set of rules, which they follow with absolute loyalty and unflinching certainty. For them, the complex, unmoving nature of the machine shows a perfection no mortal can truly attain. To ensure the protection of the vulnerable and the weak, they must strive to emulate the strength and endurance shown by the unflinching, unmoving construct in both their lifestyle and combat.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a mechanical construct to aid you.</p>
			<p class="indent">You conduct an hour long ritual that crafts a modron of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. The modron is completed at the end of the hour, manifesting in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you. You can have one modron created in this way at a time. If you create another modron using this feature and still have a previous one summoned, it is replaced by the new one.</p>
			<p class="indent">The modron you construct has a value in materials of 50gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the modron. The metal irretrievably transforms and melds to create the creature at the ritual’s end.</p>
			<p class="indent">The summoned modron obeys your orders to the best of its ability and understands one language you know, but cannot speak. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. If the modron is killed, it explodes into scrap metal before turning to dust, leaving behind any items or weapons it was carrying that were not summoned alongside it as part of the ritual.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature to create a more powerful modron construct as you gain levels in this class. At 5th level, you can create a modron with a Challenge Rating as high as 1/2. This increases to 1 at 11th level, and 2 at 17th level.</p>

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. You must then finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
