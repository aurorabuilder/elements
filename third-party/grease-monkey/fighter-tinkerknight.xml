			<p>A Tinker Knight excels at the creation and modification of armour and weaponry. Usually born or raised amongst dwarves or gnome tinkerers originating from the continent of Khorvaire, Tinker Knights are equally trained in the art of offensive and defensive combat. These warriors are often employed by wealthy nobles for protection, or brought along to political meetings as a statement of power. Drawn in by the lure of ancient artifacts or magical technology, a Tinker Knight will often embark on vast journeys to discover such a prize; using their impressive array of technical skills and mechanical knowledge to barter passage on ships to pastures new. Some return many years later, their armor gleaming with enhanced magical tech, while others never look back; their gaze always drawn to the next mysterious object lurking in a forgotten tomb, waiting to be discovered.</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, your training with modifications becomes apparent. As part of a long rest, you can spend 2 hours making modifications to one nonmagical weapon or piece of armour with which you are proficient. Choose one of the modifications from the appropriate table below. For the next 8 hours, the object gains the chosen modification and its properties.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you complete work on a new special equipment design which is personalized to your campaign theme. For example, a weapon could be a steampunk greathammer or magically-powered rocket launcher, while a piece of armour could be a steam-powered mechanized suit or nano-tech second skin. Work with your DM to find a weapon or armor design that bests suits your character and setting.</p>
			<p class="indent">The special item adopts the statistics of the closest object it resembles; you become proficient with it, and it gains the <i>Specialist</i> property, if it didn’t have it already. You can modify the appearance of your special item whenever you gain a level in this class, changing its statistics to match the new design accordingly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your special item gains additional features as you reach higher levels in this class: If the item is a weapon, it becomes magical and gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls at 10th, increasing to a +3 bonus at 15th. If the item is a piece of armour, it instead grants a +1 bonus to AC at 10th, and becomes a magical item with a +2 to AC at 15th.</p>

While attuned in this way, the magical object doesn’t count towards the limit of items you can have attuned, and is treated as part of your special item, which moulds its appearance to represent its new magical properties accordingly.</p>
