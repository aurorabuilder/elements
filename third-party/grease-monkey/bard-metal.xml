		<description>
			<p>The College of Metal is the home of bards who draw their power from aggressive, powerful ballads, constructing their instruments from the plane-touched metals of Mechanus. Fueled by bright, explosive performances, these bards are most often seen clad in heavy splint armour, supporting armies during great battles. When fighting alongside smaller bands of adventurers, these bards focus their music into terrifying displays of instrumental power to both bolster allies and demoralize their enemies. The bards of this college are regarded by others with a mixture of awe and terror, with their intimidating presence and explosive musical ability a stark contrast to other bardic colleges. Instead of tales of grandeur and adventure woven on carefully tuned lutes, these bards sing stories of colossal battles or fierce conflicts on modified battleaxes, using steel strings or hollowed bone. Bards from the College of Metal can become so enthralled and focused on the music they create they sometimes enter a mysterious battle trance, quaking the ground and arcing bolts of arcane lightning across the battlefield with each note. Heroic bards of this college use their power to inspire oppressed populaces and combat those that seek to destroy or conquer through military might or force.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you learn to perform energetic displays of musical prowess to bolster your allies and hinder your opponents. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher with a casting time of 1 action or less, you can use one of the Battle Hymn options of your choice. You can’t use more than one Battle Hymn per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ride the Lightning.</i></b> When you cast a damage-dealing spell, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal additional lightning damage to one target initially damaged by the spell. The extra damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration Die. You can then use your reaction to teleport a number of feet up to half the range of the spell you cast in a direction you choose.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Thunderstruck.</i></b> When you cast a spell that deals damage to one or more creatures, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to force one creature damaged by the spell to make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes additional thunder damage equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration Die. On a failed save, the target is instead stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Kill 'Em All.</i></b> When you cast a spell that heals a creature, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to fill it with murderous rage. The next attack roll made by that creature has advantage and deals additional damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration Die.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ten Thousand Fists.</i></b> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to fill one creature you can see within 30 feet of you with boundless energy for a brief instant. That creature can use its reaction to immediately make two unarmed strikes against a target it can see within range, rolling the Bardic Inspiration Die and adding the number rolled to the damage of each attack.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you can manipulate your Battle Hymns by focusing on a particular set of rhythmic notes, sending out pulses of arcane energy to batter your foes and embolden your allies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you use a Battle Hymn, you can use your reaction to begin a musical performance that lasts for 1 minute and is audible out to 300 feet. While performing in this way, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can replace one attack roll you make each round with a Charisma (Performance) check. If you match or exceed the target’s AC, the attack successfully hits, dealing additional force damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
				<li>Any friendly creatures that are within 60 feet and can see and hear you cannot be charmed or frightened, and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier at the start of your turn. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
