            <p>You have dedicated yourself to hunting down vast mechanical behemoths, be them elemental constructs, or powerful ATUMs of war. A Tech Hunter seeks out these constructs and ATUMs, often choosing to dispatch such a target through the use of ambushes and fast-acting traps. Skilled at taking apart their target using specialist techniques and adaptive weaponry, Tech Hunters are fearsome adversaries to face on the field of battle and experts at tracking, disabling and destroying mighty machines of war.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to mark a target you can see within 120 feet of you with a special projected overlay, that only you can see, as a bonus action on your turn. This overlay feeds you helpful information on the targets current vitals or internal components. If you use this feature against an ATUM, you also know the number of creatures currently inside it and the types of weapon modules the ATUM has installed, but not the creature’s types, current conditions or any other information pertaining to them. You can move the mark to a different target as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your mark lasts for 10 minutes. For the duration, once on your turn, you can grant yourself advantage on your next weapon attack against the marked target. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type. You can grant yourself advantage in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once this limit has been reached, the mark ends on the target, and you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to adapt your weapon to best fit a particular scenario. Choose one feature from the list below. One weapon of your choice gains the benefits of this feature whenever you use it. You can change the weapon or it’s adaptation feature when you finish a long rest. You can only have one adapted weapon at a time. If you adapt a new weapon, it replaces the previous one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Construct-Scrambler.</i></b> When you hit a construct or ATUM using this weapon, you can use your reaction to magically scramble the target’s accuracy. The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spell-Breaker.</i></b> Once per short rest, when a construct you can see within 30 feet of you targets you with a spell (innately cast or otherwise), you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against it using this weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage and you gain advantage on the saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>ATUM-Killer.</i></b> When you hit an ATUM using this weapon, you can spend your reaction to deal an additional 1d8 lightning damage to one random creature inside the ATUM, or have the attack bypass the ATUM’s armour plating. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.</p>
