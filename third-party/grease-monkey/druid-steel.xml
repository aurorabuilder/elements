			<p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Steel hail from heavily industrialized areas, often living amongst disused constructs and mountains of discarded techology. Circle of Steel druids believe that to protect the world they call home and guide cultural advancements towards a better future , they must embrace the world as it is, embracing the machine as simply an extension of nature’s grandeur. Melding the mechanical might of the machine with the purity and adaptable evolution of nature, these fierce warriors draw upon mechanical magic to aid them in battle, amassing companions of steel and adopting the form of menacing constructs to combat the unnatural threats of the world.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, your companion gains the Shield Guardian’s <i>Shield</i> and <i>Spell Storing</i> features. You can use both features only once per long rest (see page 271 of the Monster Manual for more details).</p>
			<p class="indent">Your companion always treats you as its master, though you require no amulet in order for you or it to perform either ability. If your companion is knocked unconcious, it immediately loses its stored spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Shield (1 reaction).</i></b> When a creature makes an attack against you, the Steel Companion grants a +2 bonus to your AC if the companion is within 5 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Storing (Trait).</i></b> You can cause your Steel Companion to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, you must cast the spell on the companion. The spell has no effect but is stored within the companion. When commanded to do so by you or when a situation arises that was predefined by you, the companion casts the stored spell with any parameters set by you, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.</p>
