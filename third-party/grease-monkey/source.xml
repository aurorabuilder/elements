			<![CDATA[ <p>The Greasemonkey's Handbook is a comprehensive guide to building, piloting and fighting alongside your very own mechanical constructs in the fantastic world of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.</p>
			<p>Designed from the ground up to be completely compatible with almost any campaign setting, this handbook brings the world of mechs, tanks, cars, carts, and any other mechanical, magitech or sci-fi vehicle or construct you can think of into your games. With step-by-step guides to building your own custom creations, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination.</p>
			<p>Want to introduce your world to walking dieselpunk tanks? The Greasemonkey's has rules for that. </p>
			<p>You might have decided your spelljammer sci fi homebrew campaign now needs demon-possessed robots with laser eyes, or perhaps you've decided your Eberron or Ravnica games would benefit from magictech or steampunk mobile suits; complete with mech-sized greatswords, shields and ranged weapons? Well, the Greasemonkey's Handbook has rules for that too. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>However, with the sudden influx in gigantic killer constructs, your players might be growing a little concerned their spellcasters might not be as useful as they were before. Fear not! The Greasemonkey's Handbook also introduces a brand new school of Automation magic, alongside 51 construct-themed spells, 40+ magical items, 12 new class archetypes, including the tech-hunting ranger, spell-weaving wizard, college of metal bard, and a mech pilot prestige class!</p>
			<p>Tear apart enemy mechs with the Deconstruct spell, or manifest a wall of rotating gears to shield your allies from harm. Or draw upon the divine power of Mechanus to summon a squadron of modrons to do your bidding, while quickly transforming the scrap of long-dead constructs into a fearsome mechanical dragon, taking the fight to your enemy's door. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab your spanners and roll up those sleeves - it's mech building time!</p> ]]>
