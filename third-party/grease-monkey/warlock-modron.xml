		<description>
			<p>Your patron is one of the many modrons that inhabit Mechanus. Your binding pact with such a mysterious creature transforms your soul into pure, mechanical energy, allowing you to commune with objects and percieve the interworkings of the machine with absolute clarity. Being connected to such a deity can cause changes in your behaviour and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to destroy the demons of chaos and enemies of order, or developing a fascination with the finer details found in smithing and techological craftsmanship.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, your soul burns with the pure energies of Primus. You can innately cast the <i>light of the primus</i> cantrip at will, without requiring verbal or somatic components.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you can choose to have the spell target yourself instead of an object. If casting the spell in this way, instead of hurling an object, the explosion of light centers on you, forcing each creature of your choice within range to make the saving throw.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 6th level, you have learned how to project a portion of your soul into mechanical objects and inanimate constructs.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you can touch an inanimate object or construct made of metal and experience any events that have occurred within 20 feet of it within the last 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">These events you experience project around the object or construct for the next ten minutes, appearing as a ghostly, spectral recording only you can see. You see and hear the events as if you were there, but cannot use your other senses. You can pause the recording, but cannot passively speed it up or slow it down. You can, however, specify a particular time of day, such as “early morning” or “9:24pm”, or say a phrase such as “go backwards two minutes” or “forward ten minutes”, and the recording will fast-forward or rewind to that point before playing as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack while under the effects of your Energized Soul feature, you can transpose part of your soul into the target creature for a short time.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target is not a construct, it suddenly and violently emits a torrent of pure energy, taking 10d6 radiant damage and becoming blinded and incapacitated for 1 minute as your energized soul burns it from the inside out. In addition, the target eminates bright light out to 10 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet for the duration of the blindness.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on itself on a success.</p>
