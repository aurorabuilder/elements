		<description>
			<p>When you attack with this ammunition, regardless of whether or not you hit, you can repeat the attack roll against the same creature you fired at again at the beginning of your next turn. If the creature was brought to 0 HP by the ammunition on the first attack, you can instead make the second attack roll at a different target within 30 feet of the creature attacked at the beginning of your next turn. Otherwise this ammunition drops to the ground harmlessly. If both attack rolls were able to be made with this ammunition, it loses its magic and becomes mundane.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you make an attack roll with this ammunition, it has advantage. On a hit, the round begins to glow and seems to draw attacks toward it. The next creature that makes an attack roll against the creature hit by the ammunition makes the roll with advantage. On a hit, the creature's attack deals an extra d6 damage. The ammunition then loses its magic when used.</p>
			<p class="indent">The round can always be recovered after a battle if it does not hit a creature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This weapon, hidden deep within the confines of a mad laboratory, is a strange conglomeration of science and necromancy, and appears to be a human wizard and a magic using gunslinger’s attempt to keep their favorite pet around after its passing. The brain itself, or at least a piece of it is floating in a jar attached to the body of the gun, and the sights are arranged with two floppy ear like mechanisms. The face of the deceased animal is painted either on the body itself or around the sights, and magic runes of necromancy are engraved into its barrel.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only a gunslinger or a wizard can attune to this weapon. Any other creatures attempting to do so will be growled at by the weapon and fail to attune to it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this odd sentient firearm. It has the following additional properties. Sentience. Man’s Best Friend contains the soul of a friendly dog with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 8. It has 60 feet of darkvision, and also has advantage on saving throws on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon can understand Common, any language its previous masters knew and any language you know while attuned to it. It communicates in barks, yips, whines and growls that are audible out to 60 feet. However, it can translate those barks when speaking directly to you as primal feelings and emotions, such as fear, excitement or sadness.</p>
			<p>Personality. Man’s Best Friend is extraordinarily curious, and will constantly try to direct you towards interesting things, such as caves, treasure, and squirrels. It is extremely loyal to you once you form a bond to it, and will growl whenever it senses dangerous intentions from other creatures, or pant happily in the presence of creatures friendly to you. The weapon can move ever so slightly in your grip, but never enough to force your aim off or drop it. It usually does this when it wishes to be pet. Man’s Best Friend thrives on affection and assurance, and if those things are not regularly provided to it by its wielder, a conflict between the two will occur after 10 consecutive days of neglect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Nose For Danger. This weapon makes Wisdom (Perception) rolls whenever it chooses to check for hostile creatures within range of its senses, rolled by the DM. If it senses any, the ears perk up on the gun and it begins to emit a low growl. It will roll Wisdom (Insight) checks every minute you spend in the presence of a creature that is indifferent to you or does not know you personally. If it senses ill intent or hostility, it will react similarly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bloodhound. Man’s Best Friend can cast find traps and 5th level hunter’s mark once per long rest. It decides when to cast these spells, and will maintain concentration on the latter.</p>
			<p class="indent">Guard Gun. When in combat, the gun will bark viciously when attacking, and will yip and whine when its wielder is badly hurt. The gun can take its own actions in combat, and will always take its turn before its wielder in the initiative order. The gun can use its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check or give a bark of encouragement to you, granting you a d4 to use on your next attack roll or saving throw for 1 minute or until used.</p>
