	<element name="Misfire" type="Weapon Property" source="Arcane Artillery" id="ID_INTERNAL_WEAPON_PROPERTY_MISFIRE">
		<description>
			<p>Misfire (Optional Rule). This rule is made only for games where firearms are prominent and you wish to emphasize inferiority of Primitive Firearms. These rules only apply to them in this instance. If you make an attack roll and the roll matches or is lower than a firearm's misfire number, (such as 2, for example), your gun jams. You cannot make an attack with it again until you spend an action to clear the chamber. Your firearm's misfire number then goes up by 1, to a maximum of 5. You can spend 1 minute and make a DC 10 + your firearm's misfire number Dexterity(Tinker's tools) or Intelligence(Tinker's tools) check to reduce your gun's misfire number by 1, to a minimum of its original misfire number.</p>

	<element name="Scatter" type="Weapon Property" source="Arcane Artillery" id="ID_INTERNAL_WEAPON_PROPERTY_SCATTER">
		<description>
			<p>Scatter. Firearms with the scatter property have two types of damage, a regular damage roll and a scatter damage roll. When you hit a creature with a firearm that has the scatter property, creatures within 5 feet of the target take scatter damage if the attack would hit them. The original target does not take this damage. You gain resistance to the scatter damage dealt from your firearm attacks.</p>

	<element name="Automatic" type="Weapon Property" source="Arcane Artillery" id="ID_INTERNAL_WEAPON_PROPERTY_AUTOMATIC">
		<description>
			<p>Automatic firearms can make a separate attack that releases a salvo of bullets per pull of the trigger. As an action, you can force any creatures of your choice in a 25-foot square centered on a point within your firearm's maximum range to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the gun's automatic damage (listed in parenthesis) on a failed save, and half that damage on a success. This action subtracts 10 rounds from your gun. You can use this action only if you have the ammunition available to do so. Firearms with the automatic property always expend six ammunition per attack. Automatic Save DC (Proficient) = 8 + Dexterity modifier Automatic Save DC (Proficient) = 8 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus</p>

		<description>
			<p>Burst Fire. Burst fire firearms are able to make a special attack that releases a stream of multiple bullets. As an action, you can force up to 6 creatures of your choice in a 15-foot square centered on a point within your gun's maximum range to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking your gun's burst fire damage (listed in parenthesis) on a failed save, and half that damage on a success. This action subtracts 6 rounds from your gun. You can use this action only if you have the ammunition available to do so. Additionally, guns with the burst fire property always expend 3 rounds per attack. Burst Fire Save DC (Not Proficient) = 8 + Dexterity modifier Burst Fire Save DC (Proficient) = 8 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus</p>

		<description>
			<p>Reload. Some ranged weapons can be fired a number of times before they must be reloaded. Ranged weapons with the reload property take an action (player's choice) to reload its ammunition. If you wield two light ranged weapons with the reload property, you can reload them both at once as an action during your turn.</p>
