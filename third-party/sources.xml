			<![CDATA[<p>Critical Role has taken the roleplaying world by storm. Now, you can join the adventure! Until now, the wondrous and dangerous lands of Tal’Dorei have been the sole stomping grounds of the show’s adventuring company, Vox Machina. But now, you can explore these realms in a tome from the pen of Game Master Matt Mercer himself! Will you find one of the revered Vestiges of Divergence or perhaps discover part of the Chroma Conclave's legacy? Can you help the Ashari in their sacred charge to prevent the elemental vortices from overwhelming the world, or will you find yourself embroiled in the machinations of the Clasp? This setting book takes an in-depth look at the history, people, and places of Tal’Dorei, and includes new backgrounds, magic items, and monsters for the Fifth Edition rules.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>As featured on D&amp;D Beyond, this supplement introduces additional feats that allow you to explore your character’s race further. These feats are each associated with a race from sources outside the Player’s Handbook, as summarized in the Racial Feats table below.</p><p>As with the feats found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, using these racial feats means that your connection with your race’s culture has deepened or something more dramatic has happened, such as a physical transformation through age, powerful magic, or a spectacular event in your campaign.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>The Compendium of Forgotten Secrets: Awakening is a supplemental content expansion for the 5th Edition tabletop roleplaying game. Unleash power unlike any other, and change the fate of the world!</p>
			<p>Within these pages are seventeen eldritch forces, known as Alrisen, that will tempt players with power and curse them with dark magic. Each offers two unique character subclasses, and some offer a unique player-character race option. It also contains over 80 new spells, 100 warlock invocations, 17 familiars, and dozens of magical items. Carefully designed and balanced by a community of expert content creators, the mechanics presented within will feel right at home at your table.</p>
			<p>This content was created with one goal: Inspire fun and exciting roleplaying opportunities while providing crunchy, effective rules that will highlight the experiences players are looking for! Lovingly illustrated by a team of incredible artists, journey into a world created by your own imagination and see how the dice determine your fate.</p>
			<p>Whether you decide to build and preserve with the Eternal Citadel, bring ruin with the Accursed Archive, maintain the balance in service to the Warrior-Saint, let it all burn at the Ashen Wolf's side, forget your past through the Weaver of Lies, or make a pact with one of the twelve other Alrisen, you'll find party members to join you on your wild adventures!</p>
			<p>Each Alrisen acts as an Otherworldly Patron, granting power to warlocks who join their service. Other classes also gain a total of seventeen new options, such as the monk's Path of the Noble Serpent or the bard's College of Harbingers. These add new player options for everyone at the table, and offer new opportunities for character development.</p>
			<p>Players are not alone, however. As a game master, you'll gain dozens of pages of interesting lore and roleplaying tips that will help you make the Alrisen your own. Re-imagine the Wild Huntsman as a cursed sword of frost, or have your Perfect Chord be the world's most talented musician, all while maintaining the compelling themes that drive their individual motivations and personal quests.</p>]]>
