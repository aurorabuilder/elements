        <description>
            <p>In a landscape tormented by all manner of beasts, devils, and abominations from beyond the veil, most live in fear of the dark, of superstition, and of the unknown. Some grow hardened by this experience, instead choosing to stand up and fight against the tide of shadow. These folk are called ‘heroes’.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some, however, are so fanatical and bent on destroying the anethema that plagues the countryside that they embrace dark, forbidden knowledge. They sacrifice some of their own vital force in dubious, forgotten blood rituals to better understand their enemies. Their methods sometimes blur the line between themselves and the evils they hunt, calling their own humanity into question.</p>
            <p class="indent">These folk are called ‘Blood Hunters’.</p>
            <h4>BECOME THE ENEMY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENEMY</h4>
            <p>These warriors have chosen to merge the martial pursuit of deadly weapon paly with elements of vicious blood magic to create impressively effective combat techniques. They surrender their own vitality to form a bond with their weapon, allowing them to harness the elements in a whirlwind of dangerous strikes. Their deep knowledge and unnatural connection with wicked creatures allows them an advantage in tracking, hunting, and destroying even the most resilient of abhorrent fiends. By mastering control over their own lifeblood and the lifeblood of others, they gain insight into their foes and the ability to manipulate them from the inside. Some brew crude, poisonous alchemical tonics from the harvested organs of felled monsters, mutating their blood and bodies to be even further in tune with their quarry, becoming something other than human themselves. Others go further, reaching out and making a pact with lesser dark entities in hopes of using their grim gifts against greaters evils. Many blood hunters push too far for their goals, falling to their own hubris and becoming the monsters they’ve chosen to hunt. This is the greatest feat of a blood hunter, and of the societies at large that shun them.</p>
            <h4>ALMOST AS FEARED AS THEIR PREY</h4>
            <p>The nature of their abilities and training has bred many rumors across the lands, some of which aren’t too far from the truth. Common folk consider them cursed, often turning them away at the door. Nobles see them as occasionally convenient, but a generally reviled nuisance. Mages find them useful allies if kept at arm’s length, while pious clerics and paladins keep their distance with a watchful eye. To be a blood hunter is to accept a life of solitude until proven trustworthy and dependable.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A BLOOD HUNTER</h4>
            <p>As you create your blood hunter, keep in mind how your character relates to society and why they have taken to a life of monster hunting. Do they wish to protect society and as such have paid the ulitmate price? Do they have a family they wish to protect at all costs? Did they make a mistake that cost them greatly, and they wish to make amends for their folly? Or are they bent on vengeance for some past wounds or loss that drove them to choose this dark warrior’s path?</p>
            <p class="indent">While a blood hunter begins their journey alone, they also acknowledge the strength in numbers and the benefits of trusted companions. Many blood hunters keep allies to both ensure that they succeed at their hunts, and to keep a watchful eye to prevent them from losing touch with their humanity. A blood hunter without conviction in lost, and often an honest friend is enough to keep them from straying.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a blood hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons, or ranged and finesse weapons. Make Wisdom your next highest if you plan to focus on the potency of blood curses and mystical powers. Choose a higher Constitution next if you wish to use Crimson Rite on multiple weapons or want to have extra hit points to burn on amplifying blood curses. Then, select the Haunted One or Acolyte background.</p>

            <p class="indent">You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, Fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

            <p class="indent">Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to a roll of your crimson rite damage die to gain advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or Charisma (Intimidation) check.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite until your next short or long rest. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a crimson rite is activated, you suffer damage equal to your character level, and you reduce your maximum hit points by an amount equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons, costing additional hit points loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a seperate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time on your turn (no action required).</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</p>

At the beginning of your next turn, you manifest a spirit form in your space that picks up your weapons and continues fighting on, acting on your turn and every one of your subsequent turns under your control. Your spirit form has your physical attributes and armor class, as well as your weapons and ammunition, and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. This form is immune to cold, necrotic, and non-magical weapon damage. Your spirit form has access to all of your abilities and suffers no damage from your Crimson Rite feature.</description>

		<description>
			<p>The magics adopted by the wayward blood hunter prove formidable against many an evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance. These fiends are far trickier to hunt, and many lost their lives in pursuit of such wickedness.</p>
			<p class="indent">A small sect of blood hunters had finally had enough and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outweighed the price, for even devils now quake when they know they’ve drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.</p>

			<p>When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 (phb) for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 (phb) for the Warlock spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd­-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</em></strong> At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st-level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th-level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC = 8</strong> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.</p>

			<p>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell—a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexbade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends. </p>
