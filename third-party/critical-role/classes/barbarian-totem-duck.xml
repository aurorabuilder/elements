			<p>You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment- that incorporates feathers, bones, iconography, or crude, cartoonish drawings of a duck. At your option, you also gain minor physical or mental attributes that are reminiscent of a duck. For example, you may develop feather in certain areas of your body that require consstent grooming, or subconsciously quack to yourself when confused or met with an unnerving sound.</p>
			<p class="indent">While raging, when an attacker that you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, helping you to shrug off the blow. Like water off a duck's back.</p>

			<p class="indent">You gain resistance to acid damage, as the liquid mostly slides off your strangely waxy exterior. In addition, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>

			<p>You could chose another totem, but if you came this far, don't be a dick and chose the duck.</p>
			<p class="indent">While raging, if you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can forgo one of your other attacks to flap your arms while honking and flailing at that same time. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw(DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your charisma modifier) or be frigthened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
