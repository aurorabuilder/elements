        <description>
            <p>Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wild beast. Those that shun the curse spend their lives burying their wild, bestial urges deep inside. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impluse. Those that embrace the dark nature of their curse learn to harness their bestial gifts, but also succumb to the evil, vicious temperament that drives the beast within.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming”, a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthrophy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the moster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one’s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order’s blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form the short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives in your blood. As an action, you can transform into your Hybrid form. This form lasts for 10 minutes. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form in you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. The benefits of this form replace the rules for Lucanthropy withing the Monster Manual.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Feral Might.</i></b> You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Resilient Hide.</i></b> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren’t silvered. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Predatory Strikes.</i></b> Your unarmed strikes are considered a single weapon in regards to your crimson rite feature. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strikem you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. This die increases to 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 18th level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Cursed Weakness.</i></b>  You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Bloodlust.</i></b> At the start of your turn, if you’ve taken any damage since the beginning of your last turn, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control. The DC equals 10, or half of the total damage you’ve taken from attacks since your last turn, whichever number is higher. On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against the creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the Barbarian’s rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</p>
