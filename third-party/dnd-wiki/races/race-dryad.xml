            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Dryads resemble highly humanoid beings only made out of smooth, brown-green wood, and with grass and leaves for hair. In some cases you will see that some Dryad's have both hair and eye's that change with the seasons.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>

            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Although most Dryad's prefer to stay away from town's and cities they thrive with each other in the forest. The Dryad's happily go day to day talking with other Dryad's and Fey Folk.</p>
            <h4>DRYAD NAMES</h4>
            <p>A Dryad takes their name from something in Nature or a name that their parent chooses.</p>
