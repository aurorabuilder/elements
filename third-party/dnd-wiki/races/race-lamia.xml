            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>The Lamia are a reptilian race with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a snake. a Lamia's tongue is very long in length and has a naturally "forked" tip. Like a snake, the tip of a Lamia's tongue possesses the Jacobson's organ, a sensory organ that allows a Lamia to detect smells in the air. Lamias posses a sensory organ similar to pitvipers that allows them to see heat signatures. With it, they can follow the heat signature of their prey even in the dark. The tip of a lamia's tail is extremely sensitive.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Believed to be deadly towards humans, Lamia are reputed to lure men back to their lairs and kill them after they've had their way with them. However, this is only partially true, as due to being a female-only race, Lamias would lure men to their villages and hold them as 'Communal Husbands'. If the male is resistant, Lamia will use alchemical compounds such as incense to draw out their lust and force themselves upon them. Usually all the eligible members of the village would get involved. Following the initial mating, the male has a choice to voluntarily stay or leave. Since issues arose because of the Lamia practice of kidnapping and keeping 'communal husbands' against their will, many groups would target them. To end hostilities the lamias stopped this practice and in an attempt to compensate for this, Lamia villages have taken to send out members of the village to find a willing mate(can be of any normal humanoid species).</p>
            <h4>LAMIA NAMES</h4>
            <p>Lamias tend to have names as varied as humans.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Female: </b>Sea, Gina, Miia, Lucine, Iormu             
            </p>
            <h4>LAMIA TRAITS</h4>
            <p>A race of reptilian females with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a snake.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your Constitution score increases by 2.<br />
                <span class="feature">Age.</span>Lamia reach maturity at 15 and can live to be as old as 750.<br />
                <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Varies as much as it does for humans.<br />
                <span class="feature">Size.</span>Large. Normally occupies the normal space of a large creature. Lamia creatures require four times as much food and water per day. Lamia creatures have double the carrying capacity. Lamia are able to coil up to fit in the same size square as a medium creature and can squeeze through small opening at least as easily as a normal medium sized creature. Lamias are unable to wield large weapons any easier than a medium creature could.<br />
                <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 35 feet, though you slither as a snake instead of walking like a normal humanoid. You also have a swim speed of 35 feet and climb speed of 35 feet.<br />
                <span class="feature">Snake-Like.</span>Because she is reptilian, if her environment isn't warm enough, her bodily functions will slow down, and she will feel the need to hibernate. Extreme cold is considered 20 degrees Fahrenheit and below instead of normal and they are vulnerable to cold damage, however extreme heat is considered 115 and higher instead of normal. Lamia will shed their skin once in awhile(around once every 180 days or twice a year), just like regular snakes(the only skin shedding being the snake part not the human skin). The lamia can, at the end of a rest while shedding, spend an hour caring for herself and finish shedding, however if she does not spend this time to care for herself it can last an entire week. Interestingly, Lamias find being seen skin shedding to be more embarrassing than being seen naked because of this while shedding they have disadvantage on charisma checks. Given that they are part snake, Lamia can also go without food for up to 10 days(however must make up for this when eating again). They are also carnivores. Perception checks based off of smell are at advantage due to the tip of a Lamia's tongue possessing the Jacobson's organ, a sensory organ that allows a Lamia to detect smells in the air.<br />
                <span class="feature">Blindsight.</span>Because of the lamias Pit Vision(sensory organ allows her to see infrared) and their keen sense of smell they effectively have Blindsight out to 20 feet<br />
                <span class="feature">Snake body.</span>Lamia are able to slam a foe with their tails or attempt to grapple with it.(1d4+str bludgeoning damage on slam. the lamia can constrict a grappled foe once a turn without using an action for 1d6+str bludgeoning damage).<br />
                <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common.<br />

As a result they must surface regularly to breathe which has resulted them being sighted by numerous seafaring vessels throughout the centuries.</p>
