            <p>You grew up searching for hidden veins of ore, gems, and mineral wealth. You have experienced the thrill of following the geologic clues hidden in bands of rock and soil to pockets of precious gold or gemstones. You have also cried tears of frustration when the vein of ore that could make you rich and famous petered out after only a few feet, yielding barely enough wealth to pay for repairing your tools before moving on to search another promising claim.</p>

            <p>You have an uncanny knack for ascertaining the features of the underlying geology and bedrock based on surface soil and plant conditions. You understand which types of rock are likely to yield precious metals and minerals. Although this knack will not lead you directly to the mythical pot of gold, it may be able to point you in the right general direction. This geological knowledge might possibly also come in handy in predicting where lava and underground water might be found.</p>
