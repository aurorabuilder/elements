            <p>You’ve spent the majority of your life as an island hopper. You are excellent at getting what you need from the land, but particularly so from bodies of water. Huge, open spaces make you feel at home, as they can make you feel alone even when with others. Civilization is mostly foreign to you, but you know the ways of the wild and the ocean. You have endured great storms on a raft you lashed yourself, sailed for weeks guided by only the stars, and lived happily among the rocks and reefs other seafarer’s see as death. Whether you were a secluded fisherman, a self-imposed castaway, or a sailor whose port was the ocean, your map is the stars and your boat is anything that floats!</p>

            <p>You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth</p>
