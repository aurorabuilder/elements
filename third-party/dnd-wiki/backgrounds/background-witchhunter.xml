            <p>All your life you have found Necromancers, Hags, Fiendish Warlocks and all other practitioners of evil magic abhorrent. You seek to root out and slay these monstrosities wherever they may hide. Witch hunters all have different reasons for taking up their profession. Were you hired by a king or other noble to protect their city from an evil deity or cult? Or maybe you are a cleric or paladin dedicated to seeking out all those who endorse the abomination of arcane magic? Think about what led you to develop such a hatred. Perhaps your younger sister was abducted by a hag, and replaced with a changeling that you were then forced to kill, or your mother and father were sacrificed then raised again by a wicked mage. What are your methods? Do you imprison those you capture in pits? Burn them? Or even drag them back to your lordly master for a public execution?</p>

            <p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to identify necromancy, fiendish or fey magic, or a practitioner of any of these techniques (this includes identifiying a Fey, Fiend or Undead, even if they do not directly practice that type of magic). Also you can roll on intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
