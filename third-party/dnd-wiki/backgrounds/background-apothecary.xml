            <p>You have studied the myriad illnesses and ailments of the mortal body as well as the treatments for each. You know which herbs can soothe a fever and which oils can help prevent the pox. Not all medicine is good for the body, though: you have also learned which toxins can stop the heart or drive a man to madness. You know how to manufacture and refine all of these things, and you make a living dispensing tonics and tinctures to those in need. In a pinch, you can even perform minor medical procedures, although these things are better left to a proper surgeon.</p>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>Apothecaries are defined by their attention to detail. Because so many of the illnesses they treat often have similar symptoms, they are careful about the things they say and the questions they ask, always looking to gather precise and accurate information. They tend towards cleanliness and organization, as they need to keep their tools sterile and their supplies ready at all times.</p>

            <p>You have a reputation as a healer of the sick, and are often called upon by those who are diseased or injured. You can usually gain an audience with anyone who needs treatment — even if protocol would normally prevent you from doing so — simply by agreeing to offer your assistance. By spending a few moments examining a chemical — a vial of liquid, a packet of ground powder, or the like — you can determine whether the substance is intended to harm or heal (or neither). This examination does not reveal any specific information about the substance(such as that a powder is actually an inhaled poison, or that it paralyzes its victim), only that it is either harmful or helpful to those that it is used on.</p>
