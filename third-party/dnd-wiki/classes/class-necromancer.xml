    <description>
      <p>While others use magic to do paltry things like conjure fire or fly, the Necromancer is a master over death itself. They study the deep and forbidden secrets that raise the dead, controlling minions toward a variety of goals.  Perhaps they seek the power that mastery over death provides. Perhaps they are serious and unashamed scholars, who reject the small-minded boundaries held to by others. Each enemy they fell becomes an eager and disposable ally, they become immune to the energies of death and decay, and ultimately harness the immortality and power of undeath for themselves.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A NECROMANCER </h4>
      <p>A necromancer is a caster that is able to expel negative energies flowing through their veins. Necromancers are similar to sorcerers, but are more adept with necromancy and, to some extent, enchantment spells. They use their abilities to gain absolute control over their enemies' bodies, minds, and souls. Often the best way to do this is by raising/summoning undead from their fallen enemies; a skill at which they are unparalleled. Necromancers are also effective with diseases, poisons, and affecting opponents with fear, fatigue, exhaustion, pain, life drain, or even gaining mindless supporters through the use of enchantment magic to charm and dominate.</p>
      <p>A necromancer's strengths are in bolstering undead, summoning or raising undead minions (which they can control up to a number of a large mob) and being able to cast a vast repertoire of various necromancy spells. They are strong spell casters but are not durable in physical combat. A necromancer should primarily be used for crowd control, able to curse the enemy while animating different undead to occupy the enemy while their teammates continue to sustain a mass of dead bodies for you.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You draw on the negative energy in the world to fuel your spells.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell false life and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast false life using either slot.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.</p>
      <p>The Spells Known column of the Necromancer table shows when you learn more necromancer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
      </p>
      <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
      <p>You can cast a necromancer spell as a ritual if it is a spell you know and that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells.</p>
    </description>
    <sheet display="true">
      <description>You can prepare {{necromancer:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the your spellbook. You use an arcane focus to cast spells. And can also cast Necromancer spells as a ritual.</description>

You may cast the spell <i>animate dead</i> as an action and you do not require a corpse or pile of bones to do so; the skeleton or zombie will claw its way up from underground and acts on your next turn. In addition, you learn the spell <i>animate dead</i>. This spell does not count against your number of spells known.</p>

Some necromancers alter their appearance with stitches sewn on their face, body, legs, or arms. Others may adorn the remains of corpses to impose fear and keep people away. The overexposure to death has earned an affinity with undead. Whenever you interact with undead, you have advantage on all Charisma checks.

      <p>An undertaker is from the Occult that specializes in raising the dead. Whether it be passing through town and filling in for a businessman or collecting minions from a graveyard, the years of preparing corpses has taught the undertaker how to make her undead a force unequal to others. Her minions are tougher and fight longer. She always has a skeleton or zombie at her side to carry out tasks and can quickly raise an army when others want to surround her.
