			<p>At 1st level, your connection to the fabric of magic allows you to draw inspiration from many varieties of spellcasting. You learn two spells of your choice from any class. These spells count as sorcerer spells for you. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have spell slots, or a cantrip. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one spell gained from this ability and replace it with another spell from any class. You learn an additional spell from this feature at 4th, 9th, 14th and 20th level.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you begin to master the essence of magic, using it to punish your foes more heavily than other casters. You can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of any cantrip you cast. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can spend a sorcery point to add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll, or one roll of the <i>color spray</i> or <i>sleep</i> spells. This can be used in conjunction with Metamagic effects. Furthermore, you can choose an additional metamagic talent to add to those already known.</p>

			<p>At 14th level your focus and intensity with certain spells increases. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to spend 3 sorcery points and ignore the concentration requirement if it is a concentration spell, potentially allowing the effect to persist for its' maximum duration. All other aspects of the spell still apply, including range requirements and saving throws. You can only ever have one active effect in use with this ability, and if you cast another spell using this ability, the first spell immediately ends. Until you take a long rest, your maximum number of sorcery points available decreases by 3 for every time you use this ability.</p>

			<p>At 18th level your harmful spells grow more powerful, capable of extreme destruction upon those you wish it on. Whenever you roll for the damage dealt by a spell, you may spend any number of sorcery points to re-roll a number of damage die. Spending one sorcery point allows you to re-roll up to two damage die. You can re-roll the damage dice for ongoing effects, such as the <i>wall of fire</i> spell, when a creature takes damage from it, and from instantaneous effects at the time of casting. </p>
