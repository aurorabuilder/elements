		<description>
			<p>Touching the stone walls, with a look of fascination in his eyes, a dwarf examines the ancient glyphs engraved on it, feeling the power they emanate with his fingertips and comparing them with the runes he etched on his axe. The axe suddenly shouts to warn him of danger, without hesitation he swings it at a sneaky group of shadow creatures. The moment the axe cuts the first one, the runes decorating it gleam light and erupt in an explosion of flames.</p>
			<p class="indent">Riding a wyvern covered in runic tattoos, a human clad in golden plate armor charges at high speed towards a red dragon in the sky, whispering an incantation as she couches her lance that becomes colder than ice. The dragon strikes with his claws against her large shield as she pierces his scales with her lance.</p>			
			<p class="indent">A tiefling scarred by runes and horrifying drawings all over his face and his muscular body stands in the middle of a magic circle, chanting and dancing slowly holding a longsword in his hands. Suddenly he slices all along his own arm, letting the blood flow on the circle, the light of the candles becomes extremely bright and in a flash of light a demon appears in front of him. He commands it to kneel before him, and a diabolic grin appears on his face when the order is obeyed.</p>			
			<h4>CONSTANT STUDY</h4>
			<p>Runeseekers are as interested in improving their magical power as they are in simply satisfying their strong curiosity, with a passion for history and tradition. Runes are a very ancient source of magical power, much more than the spells found written in books with ink, their understanding requires as much constant study as it requires direct experience and excavation missions in ancient ruins.</p>
			<h4>PRACTICAL THINKERS</h4>
			<p>Runeseekers are usually practical thinkers, they know well that delving into caverns filled with monsters is dangerous, and they prefer being well equipped. Runeseekers traditionally store their knowledge on useful objects, usually weapons that they also cover with enchantments, and in order to learn how to carve their runes they often become excellent weapon crafters.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are many more runes than the traditionally known ones that evolved into the dwarvish script, most magical runes are ideographic, not phonographic, and their shape can change greatly from culture to culture, runeseekers learn their hidden meaning in order to activate their magical powers. While runeseekers most commonly use runes with a norse style, sometimes they take the shape of oriental ideographs, detailed glyphs, tiny alchemic circles, cuneiform pictographs found in pyramids or even simplified doodles found in caves that were inhabited by the first men.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A RUNESEEKER</h4>
			<p>When creating a runeseeker character the most important thing is defining how he got interested in the study of ancient cultures and languages. Did you discover you are the last descendant of a destroyed culture that you now want to study and pass on to a new generation? Are you just curious to understand all the tiny facets of history and language of a civilization that you find fascinating and exotic? Did your character find a magic axe engraved in runes while mining and started studying the meaning of the symbols, wanting to know more about where it came from and who made it?</p>
			<p class="indent">What drives you to find the vestiges of old civilizations? Do you want to reconnect with the spirits of your ancestors and recover the artifacts that once belonged to them? Are you an avid reader of epic poems and believe that many of the stories written by old authors hide truth on where to find ancient cities and relics? Do you want to teach everyone about the long lost history that you find in your adventures or do you want to keep your precious discoveries and the power that derives from them for yourself?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a runeseeker quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. (Some runeseekers who focus on ranged fighting make Dexterity higher than Strength.) Second, choose the guild artisan background. Third, choose the Beacon minor property and the Confident quirk for your runic weapon.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Runes can be found hidden in the most unexpected places, and they can look like meaningless cuts on stones even to the most experienced wizard, your experience in exploring ancient ruins and your knowledge of ancient cultures is unparalleled. You have advantage on Intelligence (History) checks related to the buildings and engravings of ancient civilizations, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks in the surroundings of the remains of ancient civilizations when looking for hidden runes and runestones.</p>
			<p class="indent">Runestones function like scrolls, except that they are only a few symbols engraved on small stones and they are written in lost runic characters that are not related to any specific language, but represent directly magical energies. Only runeseekers can activate runestones.</p>

	<element name="Runic Weapon" type="Class Feature" source="D&amp;D Wiki" id="ID_WIKI_CLASS_FEATURE_RUNESEEKER_RUNIC_WEAPON">
		<description>
			<p>You have a supernatural bond with your favorite weapon, a weapon that you enchanted with runes, or that you found or received already bearing ancient runes. When you get this feature choose one of your weapons, that weapon becomes your runic weapon. Your runic weapon is indestructible and you can summon it as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly in your hand. The weapon has a minor property and a quirk. Choose one of the minor properties in the Minor Property table in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, then choose a quirk from the Quirk table in the same page, discuss with your DM any detail about the minor property and the quirk if necessary. If you are not the creator of your runic weapon you might want to choose with your DM characteristics from the Creator or Intended User table and the History table as well. Your DM might want you to roll on these two tables instead of choosing. </p>
			<p class="indent">The runic weapon does not require attunement but you can only use one runic weapon at a time. The runic weapon doesn’t count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You can change your weapon at any time by spending an amount of time equal to your your proficiency bonus (hours).</p>

			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
			<h5>DUELING</h5>
			<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
			<h5>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

	<element name="Spellcasting" type="Class Feature" source="D&amp;D Wiki" id="ID_WIKI_CLASS_FEATURE_RUNESEEKER_SPELLCASTING">
		<description>
			<p>Studying the runes confers you magic power, runes are extremely concise and your runic weapon has enough space to contain all your spells, growing more and more covered in inscriptions as your repertoire expands. You choose spells from the runeseeker spell list. See chapter 10 on the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the runeseeker spell list.</p>
			<p>Runic Weapon as Spellbook</p>
			<p>When you get spellcasting at 2nd level, your runic weapon contains six 1st-level runeseeker spells of your choice. The spells that you add to your runic weapon as you gain levels are each in the form of few specific runic characters coming from the research you conduct around ruins and in libraries, as well as from intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the way the runic characters interact. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a runic spell recorded on the grave of an ancient mage king, for example, or out of luck on a pebble on the side of a river, or on the sword of an evil runeseeker you just defeated. Copying a spell into the runic weapon works exactly like a wizard spellbook minus the gold expense, but you can’t replace your runic weapon nor lose it, however you can create backups of your spells on stones or tablets even though it is usually not necessary.</p>
			<p>Preparing and Casting Spells</p>
			<p>The runeseeker table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of runeseeker spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of runeseeker spells from your runic weapon equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Runeseeker Level.</p>
			<p>Spellcasting Ability</p>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your runeseeker spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a runeseeker spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p><strong>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</strong><br/>
			<strong>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</strong></p>
			<p>Arcane Focus</p>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 in the Player’s Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your runeseeker spells. Your runic weapon counts as spellcasting focus for you.</p>
			<p>Martial Somatic Components</p>
			<p>You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.</p>
			<p>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</p>
			<p>Each time you gain a runeseeker level, you can add a runeseeker spell of your choice to your runic weapon. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Runeseeker table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your runic weapon.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Some runeseekers have a personal preference for enchantment, curious of finding ways to permanently influence the mind of other creatures. Others have a strong desire to be leaders and don’t like to get their hands dirty with lowly jobs. Some want to punish evil doers and take them under their control to force them to act for good under their service. In other cases they are master riders or beast trainers that want the talent to tame anything. For any of these reasons, runeseekers might discover the technique of controlling minds by tattooing enchanting runes on any creature. </p>
			<p class="indent">Often these runeseekers earn themselves different titles depending on the creatures they are most often seen with. For example dragon trainers when they manage to get a dragon under their control. Death knights or demon knights when they are seen fighting with undead creatures or fiends. Elemental lords when they manage to draw their runes on the animated elemental power that is elementals. Others are less picky about who they will control and earn more generic names like mind benders or arcane slavers. </p>

			<p>Sometimes called blood mages, blood knights or simply skincarvers, these runeseekers have no qualms when it comes to achieve more power. Experimenting with their own skin and blood they transform their weapon in a part of their body, bonding through the forbidden use of blood sacrifices. Specialised in the flow of life force and magical power, they soon start to understand how to manipulate this flow between living creatures in order to steal the vital energy out of other beings. Sometimes they try to use their macabre powers for the greater good, but when they get used to the taste of vital energy, it becomes hard to keep their grip on sanity. Others just embrace the insanity and transform their bodies in a canvas for carved runes, sometimes even transforming themselves into vampires or liches without the slightest shade of regret. </p>

			<p>At 10th level when you drain life from your foes without the need to recover from your wounds, you enter a state of uncontrolled blood lust. When you would regain hit points from blood bounty or drain surge but your current hit points are already equal to your total hit points, until the end of your next turn you gain advantage to all attack rolls and deal 1d6 more damage to any creature you hit. </p>
			<p class="indent">The effects do not stack if they are triggered again while they are already in place, the effects simply last until the end of next turn starting from the last trigger that ensued. During a bloodlust the flesh of one of your hands grows into your weapon and vice versa, blending seamlessly. You can't be disarmed from your runic weapon and you can't sheathe your sword or use the hand for anything other than attacking with your weapon until the blood lust ends. </p>

			<p>At 15th level you reach final understanding of blood magic, you can sacrifice blood to improve the power of your spells. When you cast a spell you can take 1d10 slashing or piercing damage and cast the spell as if it was cast with one higher spell slot than the one you used, or a level higher for each additional 1d10 damage that you are willing to take, if the damage brings you to 0 hit points the spell is not cast. This damage cannot be reduced by resistances, immunities or by other means. The spell level can exceed your highest spell slot level up to 8th level. When you reach 17th level the spell level can reach 9th level. For example if you are a 17th level runeseeker and you cast a 5th level spell you can take 2d10 damage to cast it as a 7th level spell, 1d10 damage to cast it as a 6th level spell or 4d10 damage to cast it as a 9th level spell. </p>
