Each soldier has the stats of a Scout with the maximum possible hit points (Monster Manual pg.349). You teach them how to handle the weaponry, training them takes one week for each soldier. Once training is complete, you can then utilize them as a loyal militia requiring no payment, but still require lifestyle expenses for each soldier (Player's Handbook pg.157). The soldiers also gain the Firearm Fighting Style Feature: they gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls they make with firearms. (The DM may also decide if the soldiers can be equipped with different items, EX:Weapons, Armor, Magic Items, etc.). You may use a bonus action on your turn to command the militia to take one of the following actions in addition to their movement: Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Search, or Use an Object.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, you have learned to augment your martial prowess with divine spellcasting.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You can choose two cantrips from the cleric spell list. At 10th level, you can choose another cantrip from the cleric spell list.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Preacher Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
	  <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield of faith and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield of faith using either slot.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level paladin spells of your choice.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Subclass Spellcasting table shows when you learn more paladin spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
	  <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from the cleric spell list.</p>
	  <p class="indent">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since your power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric or paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
	  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
