    <description>
      <p>The Prophecy domain focuses on foretelling danger and preventing harmful outcomes. Clerics of this domain are also known as “oracles.” Oracles pay special attention to dreams, intuitive thoughts, and hallucinatory visions. They are widely believed to be capable of predicting the future, though their visions are often misinterpreted. They live by the phrase, “know thyself.”</p>
      <p class="indent">Oracles often carry special varieties of incense and holy water with them. The holy water may be boiled to produce vapors, which the oracle inhales in order to enter a trance-like state. During such a trance, the oracle thrashes and wails as they experience flashes of divine insight. They often employ scribes to write down their words, so that they may be recalled later.</p>
