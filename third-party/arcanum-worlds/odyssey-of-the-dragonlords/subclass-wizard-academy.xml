		<description>
			<p>Academy philosophers are great thinkers who do not specialize in any particular spell school, but rather spend their time analyzing the nature of reality and applying that learning to their magic. They usually spend many years studying at venerable schools where philosophers from many different disciplines gather. They enjoy participating in endless debates and dialogues, and they always seek to score points on those who champion rival schools of thought.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, you have spent years solving complex mathematical equations, allowing you to shape your spells with precision and create pockets of safety for allies. When you cast a spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you may choose a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Additionally, when you cast a spell that has an area of effect radius, you may choose to increase or decrease the radius by 5 feet.</p>
