			<p>Your magic springs from the divine blood that flows through your veins. The gods have often been known to consort with mortals, and such unions sometimes produce half-divine offspring. These individuals are called demigods, and many of them are born with a powerful aptitude for magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Demigods exhibit powers that are related to the domain of their godly ancestor, but their magic is not constrained by this association. Rather, they may channel the power in their blood to improve the efficacy of any spell, regardless of its type. Additionally, the divine power that courses through their blood makes demigods impressive specimens of both physical fitness and beauty.</p>
