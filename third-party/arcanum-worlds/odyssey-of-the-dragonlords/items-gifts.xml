			<p>While mounted on a dragon, you gain that dragon’s damage resistances, damage immunities and senses (blindsight, darkvision and its passive perception if it is greater than yours). If the dragon is an adult or ancient dragon, you can also use its legendary resistance (but this counts towards the total number of uses per day).</p>

			<p>You may reroll any one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You must use the second roll. The blessing cannot be used again until after a long rest (at least several nights’ sleep, as the GM decides).</p>
