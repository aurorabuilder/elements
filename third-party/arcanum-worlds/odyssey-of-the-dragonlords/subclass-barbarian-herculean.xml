      <p>Some individuals are born with seemingly impossible strength, exhibiting rippling muscles even before they learn to speak or walk. Such men and women quickly learn that every good thing in this world may be obtained through the exercise of overwhelming might. Others may scorn them and call them “barbaric,” but what are words but useless noise to be choked out of the speaker’s windpipe?</p>
      <p class="indent">As one such individual, you know that strength is what determines one’s worth in the world: strength to crush your enemies—and to impress your allies. You savor the opportunity to show off your great strength, whether it be in battle or in friendly competition. Your incredible strength allows you to accomplish Herculean feats that will leave your foes wailing in anguish.</p>

Additionally, while raging, you are immune to poison damage and you cannot be frightened.</p>

      <p>Starting at 14th level, your colossal strength causes the ground itself to tremble and quake. On your turn, you can use your action to strike the ground and create the effects of an earthquake with a 40 ft. radius, centered on your location. This area becomes difficult terrain.</p>
      <p class="indent">Each creature on the ground in the affected area that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken. At the end of your turn, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw with the same DC as the previous one. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. You have advantage on this saving throw.</p>
      <p class="indent">At the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, you may use your bonus action to stomp the ground and continue the effects of the earthquake until the beginning of your next turn, for a maximum duration of 1 minute.
