			<p>The rank-and-file warriors of large cities are sometimes trained to fight in large armies of identically-outfitted soldiers called hoplites. Hoplites fight behind heavy shields, which have notches to accommodate the use of spears and javelins. Additionally, they may carry a sword called a xiphos for close quarters combat. Hoplites are famous for the use of the phalanx formation, which allows many soldiers to band together closely, benefiting from the protection of their neighbor’s shield.</p>
