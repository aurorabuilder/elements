On the second and subsequent slaying the user must make a DC15 Charisma saving throw or their alignment changes to evil. Affiliation to Law or Chaos is unchanged.

	<element name="Caduceus" type="Magic Item" source="Odyssey of the Dragonlords" id="ID_AW_OOTD_MAGIC_ITEM_CADUCEUS">
		<description>
			<p>The Caduceus is a staff that features five dragons winding around it, with the top featuring two unfolded dragon wings. The staff was created by the wizard Damon over five centuries ago. Forged in the primordial waters of the Nether Sea, the Caduceus was a life-giving staff with the power to turn the tide against the Titans in the First War. Damon gave it to the dragonlord named Karpathos, also known as the Wolf Lord. Karpathos used the Caduceus to raise the Dragonlords from death during the First War. But he was seduced by Lutheria into believing the staff could elevate him to godhood. Karpathos betrayed his fellow dragonlords and swore an oath to Lutheria. He later broke the oath at the urging of his wife and Lutheria transformed him into Thylea’s first vampire as punishment.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Caduceus is an item of powerful life giving. In the hands of a living being it gives the power to heal and bring back those who have died. However, in the hands of the fiendish or undead, the Caduceus works in an entirely different manner.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Caduceus has 5 charges, which recharge daily at dawn. When used by a creature that is not a fiend or undead, they can be used in the following manner:</p>
			<ul>
        		<li>Cast the heal spell (1 charge)</li>
        		<li>Cast the greater restoration spell (1 charge)</li>
        		<li>Cast the resurrection spell (5 charges)</li>
      		</ul>
			<p class="indent">When used by a fiend or undead creature, the rod can be used in the following manner:</p>
			<ul>
        		<li>Cast the create undead spell as a 9th level spell (2 charges)</li>
        		<li>Create a vampire spawn from a corpse that has been drained of blood (1 charge)</li>
        		<li>Restore 100 hit points to an undead or fiend, even if they are at 0 hit points (2 charges)</li>
      		</ul>
			<p class="indent">The Caduceus is seemingly indestructible. However, it can be broken by an empyrean with a CR of 15 or higher. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the titan contained within the Caduceus can be used to raise one empyrean from death, or it can be used to transform a creature with divine blood into a young empyrean.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This chariot is a beautifully decorated artifact made from bronze. The chariot can only be activated while during the day in the open air and cannot be used underground or during night. When activated with its command word, a team of four golden horses spring into existence to pull the vehicle. The chariot shines with a painfully radiant light in a 60 ft. radius. Anyone within that radius other than the rider takes 4 (1d6) damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The chariot has a flying speed of 90 ft. Flying is a free action, but the horses are difficult to control, and every round, the chariot rider must use a bonus action to control the horses. This requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. Failure means that the control is lost and the horses will move their full movement to climb straight up into the sky.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Game of Twenty Squares is more commonly known as "The Royal Game." The game is considered to be sacred, and it has been played by gods and mortals since the dawn of time. Kings sometimes use the game to resolve disputes that would otherwise result in war.</p>
			<p class="indent">The game requires two players, and it is played by moving seven pieces across a board comprising twenty squares. Dice are rolled to determine how quickly the pieces can move, and the object of the game is to reach the end of the twenty-square course before your opponent. This requires a mix of strategy and luck. The game is protected against magical interference, which prevents cheating with spells such as <i>mage hand</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Magical Wagers.</b> Anything can be wagered on the outcome of the game—wealth, power, magic, or even the lives of the two players. Whenever gods play the game, this wager is enforced by magic woven into the fabric of the multiverse. Depending upon the nature of the wager, as many as six rematches may be allowed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Starting the Game.</b> Two players are required to play the game. They must agree to their wager beforehand, and it is customary to cut the thumb and make a 'blood handshake' before the game begins.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Winning the Game.</b> The game is resolved by making a series of seven opposed skill checks, which represent the various strategies that can be used to win the game. Each opposed skill check to determines the outcome of a race between two game pieces. The winner of the game is the player who wins at least four rounds, which means that it is possible to win in just four rounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>The Seven Rounds.</b> The seven rounds proceed as a series of opposed skill checks. The skill checks are made in this order: Performance, Insight, History, Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Perception. Tied skill checks must be repeated until one player prevails.</p>

			<p>These apples are wrought from solid gold, and are so beautiful that they inspire immense greed in anyone who sees them.</p>
			<p class="indent">On a turn, the owner of a golden apple may use an action to throw it. Everyone within a 30-foot radius of where the apple lands must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must use their next turn to move toward the apple and attempt to take it for themselves. This saving throw is repeated on each turn if no one has possession of the apple. No other activities are possible while wanting the golden apple. Once a creature has taken possession of the apple, they will spend the next day jealously guarding it. Weaker creatures, such as bandits or goatlings, may attempt to run away and hide it from others.</p>

A creature with darkvision can’t see through the Helm’s darkness, and nonmagical light will not pierce it. The magical darkness is not dispelled by light from magical effects. The Helm’s wearer, on the other hand, has darkvision to a range of 60 feet. This darkvision is not affected by darkness from the helmet or another source.</p>

			<p class="indent">The second command word produces a paralyzing, mercurial vapor. Once per day, you may use an action to create a cloud within 60 ft. of you. The cloud starts with a 5 ft. radius, which increases by 5 ft. each round to a maximum of 30 ft. Any creature that starts its turn in the mist must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of its next turn.</p>

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. When you use the instrument to cast a spell as a source or as a focus, your spell save DC is increased by 2.</p>

			<p>This cloudy blue potion was brewed from the blood of a living god. For each droplet that a creature drinks from this potion, the creature physically ages by one year. Creatures with shorter lifespans, such as humans, should be cautious when drinking this potion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Brewing the potion is a long process that requires one droplet of divine blood to be added each year for many years. Such potions are always designated with the number of years that it took to brew them. For example, a potion of aging (25 years) contains 25 droplets.</p>
