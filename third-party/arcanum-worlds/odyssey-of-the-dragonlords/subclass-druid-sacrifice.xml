    <description>
      <p>Druids of the Circle of Sacrifice believe that nature connects one to the entire universe, including the stars and the astral void between planes. They know that immutable laws have been set down by the great powers of the universe and that sacrifices must be made to these powers in order to keep the balance. Such sacrifices take the form of great bonfires, wherein fallen creatures are immolated.</p>
      <p class="indent">Druids who keep the Circle of Sacrifice are sometimes called the Keepers of the Old Ways, and they revere mistletoe as a sacred plant connected to the infinite power of the astral plane. Mistletoe must be harvested with extreme care, following rituals that ensure that the plant maintains its potency.</p>
      <p class="indent">As one of the keepers of the Old Ways, you sometimes gather with others of your kind at sacred rings of standing stones. These standing stones connect the natural world to the heavens and the astral void.</p>

      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to perform a sacrificial ritual that pleases the gods. You know the <i>produce flame</i> cantrip. When you make an attack with <i>produce flame</i>, add your Wisdom modifier to the damage roll.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Immolation.</em></strong> Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may choose to immolate them as a sacrificial offering. As the creature is engulfed in fire, you and every ally within 60 feet of the immolated creature gain the effects of the bless spell for 1 minute (concentration is not required). You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.</p>
