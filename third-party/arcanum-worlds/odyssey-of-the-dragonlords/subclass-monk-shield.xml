        <description>
            <p>Some monasteries teach a specialized form of combat that is very different from traditional monk fighting techniques. This style is known as the Way of the Shield, and it emphasizes the shield as a living extension of the warrior. Monks of this tradition train to take advantage of shields and polearms, so that they can fight with or against large armies of hoplites in phalanx formations. Such monks commonly wear long red cloaks to disguise their intentions and add fluidity to their movements.</p>
            <p class="indent">Temples that teach the Way of the Shield are often decorated with scrolls that exalt the feats of warriors who are fearless when faced with impossible odds. Massive armies may be surprised to encounter resistance from a proud band of shield monks with less than a tenth of their numbers. Grandmasters of this tradition have even been known to stand alone against creatures many times their size.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, you have learned new techniques for using shields on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Vaulting Strike.</i></b> As a bonus action on your turn, you may spend 1 ki point to vault yourself into the air, leaping up to 15 feet in any direction. If you are wielding a shield, then this leap does not provoke opportunity attacks. If you take an Attack action immediately after leaping, then you have advantage on your first melee attack, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Counterattack.</i></b> Whenever a creature makes an opportunity attack against you and misses, if you are using a shield, you may use your reaction to spin around and make a single melee weapon attack against that creature, without interrupting your movement.</p>
