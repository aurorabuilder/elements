        <description>
            <p>The inimitable princes of the Feywild are not the only source of power in the enchanted forests and magical jungles of that realm -- indeed, there are many good reasons why a prospective warlock might not wish to deal with them. Far more stable and reliable partners can be found in the towering, ancient trees of the Feywild, whose roots reach back to the ancient past, and whose branches span to the end of time.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although journeying out into the woods to find a Great Tree with which to form a pact can be dangerous, the rewards are clear: these patrons are generous with their power, seeking to nurture their mortal charges, guiding and pruning them until they are fit to serve as guardians of the forest.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your bonus action to assume the form of a primal force of nature. Your body becomes covered entirely in bark, any hair you have becomes leaves and moss, your eyes glow amber, and you sprout a twisting pair of branch-like antlers. This form lasts for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it (no action required). For the duration, you have the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your AC equals 13 + your Constitution modifier.</li>
				<li>Your fingers twist into sharpened roots which can be used as natural weapons, dealing 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in a forest.</li>
				<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier when you enter this form.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can use this ability twice, and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, when a hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks one of your allies, you can use your reaction to ensnare them. Immediately after the attack, you slam your arms into the ground, and they transmute into twisting roots that ensnare the hostile creature. That creature must make a Strength saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save you drag it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.</p>
