            <p>Hidden within the clouds atop mountain peaks are secret monasteries, who practice the bending of Elemental Air to their will. Their fighting style utilizes the four winds as an extension of their bodies, weaving a furious display of martial arts that balances chaos and self-control. Their mastery over the winds as well as their own ki makes them formidable warriors, often sought out by students of war. The monks who practice the Way of the Howling Gale are by no means pacifists but they are reluctant to train individuals in their secret arts if those individuals seek to use their knowledge for violence.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you begin to interweave your martial arts techniques with the power of Elemental Air.</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is slashing, and its damage die is a d4. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Table. The damage of this attack counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical slashing damage. When you take the Attack action on your turn and use this special attack as part of it, you can spend 1 ki point to make the special attack twice as a bonus action.</p>
