        <description>
            <p>Your patron is a council of beings who magically bolstered and corrupted your body to make you into their chosen operative, a vicarious embodiment of their will. Your new powers grant you supernatural speed and stealth, as well as a ghastly form that strikes fear into the heart of your enemies. Patrons of this sort can be any number of shadowy organizations, such as the Dark Powers of Ravenloft, the Gloaming Court, the Mage Hand Press, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Shadow Enclave Proclamation, the Treaty of Ascended Lords from the Otherworldly Nexus, and the Umbral Council.</p>
