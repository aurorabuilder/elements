            <p>While seemingly similar to rangers, the grove knights are far less concerned with foraging and trailblazing and much more interested in protecting the woods at all costs. Often found taking down clearcutters, poachers, and  those who destroy natural wilderness with casual disregard, grove knights are never to be taken lightly.</p>

            <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Preparing and Casting Spells. The Grove Knight spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your grove knight spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of grove knight spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your fighter level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since you prepare them through prayer and meditation. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

            <p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to grow a natural weapon and attack with it at a moment’s notice. When you use your action to take the Attack action or to cast a cantrip, you can make an additional unarmed strike at a creature within reach as a bonus action. This unarmed strike deals 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) and is treated as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
