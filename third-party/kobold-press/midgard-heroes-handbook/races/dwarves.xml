			<p>The Southlands dwarves are distant relatives at best, with different language, magic, and style. In the desert heat the Southern dwarves shave their heads and wrap their beards tightly in gold or copper wire; sometimes these beards are forked or braided as well. They serve a male mask of Rava they call Ptah, and they build clockwork bodies they call shabti, or servants. Their skin is dark, and— when not shorn—their hair runs to pure black, gold, or red.</p>
			<p class="indent">Southern dwarves are alchemists and mystics, with a deep hatred of dragons and the Mharoti Empire. They have served the King of Nuria Natal faithfully as bodyguards and as his heavy infantry for centuries, and as engineers who build his temples, city walls, and step pyramids.</p>
