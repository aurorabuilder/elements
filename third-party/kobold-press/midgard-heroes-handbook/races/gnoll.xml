		<description>
			<p>The average gnoll views the virtues of work and self‑sufficiency with distaste. Gnolls with leadership skills or who tire of sharing the fruits of their labors frequently break off from the pack alone or in small groups to fend for themselves. Sometimes a male gnoll foolishly announces that he believes males are more fit to lead, and necessarily sets out on his own until he can find a new pack or the controversy is forgotten.</p>
			<p class="indent">Gnolls who possess the will to face danger make excellent adventurers.</p>
			<h4>GNOLL NAMES</h4>
			<p>Gnoll names are heavily influenced by their demonic origins. There’s no difference between the names of males and females.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>>Gnoll Names.</em></strong> Anagilkin, Khuyoag, Nothchon, Shashog, Shudnarothic, Tsoggul, Thagtharric, Yithig, Zatur</p>
			<h4>GNOLL TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your gnoll character has several special traits, the result of a wild nature and growing in a harsh environment.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Gnolls reach adulthood at age 12, and they live short and brutal lives. The rare examples that die of old age experience only around 70 summers.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> As a product of a culture that values laziness, selfishness, and dominance, most gnolls are evil. On top of that, an unpredictable existence, where every day could be the last, usually leads to a chaotic view of the world. With that said, there are always exceptions to every norm.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Gnoll females are taller and more powerfully built than their male counterparts. The former range from 7 to 8 feet and usually weigh more than 250 pounds, while the latter average 6 inches and 30 pounds less. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Scent.</em></strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bully.</em></strong> Although gnolls are cowardly at heart, they like to disguise their fears by abusing others. You have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. On the other hand, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check for dealing with obviously smaller or weaker targets, you are considered proficient in the Intimidation skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Live to Fight Another Day.</em></strong> When you take the Disengage action, your base walking speed is increased by 10 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gnoll Weapon Training.</em></strong> You have proficiency with the spear, shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, and heavy crossbow.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Southern and Gnollish. Gnollish words sound almost like growls for the uninitiated, and gnolls tend to use scents and small gestures to convey subtle meanings. Two gnolls speaking can almost seem like dogs barking at each other to a casual observer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subraces.</em></strong> Although not, strictly speaking, different races, gnolls from the civilized lands live in an environment so different from their savage brethren that they are considered separate subraces. Choose one of them.</p>
