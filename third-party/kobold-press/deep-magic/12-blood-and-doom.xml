			<p><strong>Dark Magic of Unutterable Evil!</strong></p>
			<p>“A field produces no crops until the farmer slices it open with a blade.” – Mstislav, Butcher of the Steppes</p>
			<p>Antipaladins and blood mages are amoral, self-centered, and uncompromising. This is a bad combination where party harmony is concerned—but they make excellent evil NPCs and villains for your campaign.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Blood and Doom contains the secrets of antipaladin and blood magic for 5th Edition, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Antipaladin class features and magic, including Unholy Smite, Oath of the Giving Grave, Aura of the Unrepentant, and Undying Sentinel</li>
				<li>A new Serophage sorcerous origin, featuring Strength Beneath the Skin, Blood Fuel, Blood Barrier, and Exsanguinate</li>
				<li>A Blood Magic Wizard School with 36 horrifying spells that include animate ghoul, doom of consuming fire, strength of the underworld, and vomit tentacles</li>
				<li>A new blood elemental monster, and a new wondrous item: Taergash's Exsanguinating Tome</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Undying riders thunder across the land, bringing death in their wake. Corrupt wizards, clerics, and sorcerers recite twisted spells from blood-drenched grimoires and bile dripping tomes. Your heroes have long sought foes worthy of their steel—but nothing prepared them for this.</p>
