			<p><strong>Dark Magic of Unutterable Evil!</strong></p>
			<p>“A field produces no crops until the farmer slices it open with a blade.” – Mstislav, Butcher of the Steppes</p>
			<p>Antipaladins and blood mages are amoral, self-centered, and uncompromising. This is a bad combination where party harmony is concerned—but they make excellent evil NPCs and villains for your campaign.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Blood and Doom contains the secrets of antipaladin and blood magic for 5th Edition, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Antipaladin class features and magic, including Unholy Smite, Oath of the Giving Grave, Aura of the Unrepentant, and Undying Sentinel</li>
				<li>A new Serophage sorcerous origin, featuring Strength Beneath the Skin, Blood Fuel, Blood Barrier, and Exsanguinate</li>
				<li>A Blood Magic Wizard School with 36 horrifying spells that include animate ghoul, doom of consuming fire, strength of the underworld, and vomit tentacles</li>
				<li>A new blood elemental monster, and a new wondrous item: Taergash’s Exsanguinating Tome</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Undying riders thunder across the land, bringing death in their wake. Corrupt wizards, clerics, and sorcerers recite twisted spells from blood-drenched grimoires and bile dripping tomes. Your heroes have long sought foes worthy of their steel—but nothing prepared them for this.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Blood and Doom deals with antipaladins and blood magic. Antipaladins, blood mages, and wielders of blood magic in general are intended to appear only as nonplayer characters. That’s not because antipaladin or blood mage player characters are unbalanced or no fun. They can be great fun for the person who’s playing them, but either of these characters in a group of mostly Good or Neutral PCs can be a real problem for everyone else. Evil characters in general, and antipaladins and blood mages in particular, are more than the sum of a few distasteful class abilities. Both represent an approach to life and society that’s utterly amoral, self-centered, and uncompromising—a bad combination where party harmony is concerned.</p>
			<p class="indent">Before even thinking about making up a character that uses the spells and abilities in this chapter of Deep Magic, you must clear it not only with your GM but also with the other players. Make sure everyone understands what they’re allowing into the group and that they’re willing to put up with the consequences.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even then, we don’t recommend it. These abilities are best reserved for evil NPCs and villains.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seriously—don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal necrotic damage, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st‑level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each slot level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

		<description>
			<p>The giving grave is more a philosophy than a formalized code. It appeals to warriors who value power above life, to would-be conquerors who balk at nothing when imposing their will on the weak, to warlords who seek to extend their reigns beyond the usual limit of a single lifetime, and, frankly, to psychotic killers who crave the stamp of divine approval on their bloodletting.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Conquer Death.</strong> Immense power is needed to repair what’s wrong with the world, and mortal beings’ lives are too short to acquire that power and wield it effectively. Therefore, death itself must be overcome, and the only path beyond death is through the grave.</li>
				<li><strong>Serve Those Who Can Teach.</strong> To overcome death, one must serve and learn from those who have that knowledge, regardless of one’s views about those entities. When they have no more to teach and no further aid to give, only then can the student’s moral feelings come into play.</li>
				<li><strong>Brook No Opposition.</strong> Your vision for the world is correct, and the path to achieving it is narrow and treacherous. A single misstep could lead to disaster. Anyone who obstructs that path imperils the future and therefore deserves neither life nor mercy. This isn’t cruelty; it’s necessity. Where possible, those who fall can be redeemed by being made to serve your ambition after their deaths.</li>
				<li><strong>Honor the Gods of Death.</strong> Honor the gods who grant you power over life and death with devotion and sacrifice, so that they will aid you and look favorably on you as an instrument of their power, or even as an ally. Punish those who blaspheme against them.</li>

			<p>At 18th level, you can siphon a steady stream of blood from a living creature at a distance. As an action, you designate a creature within 40 feet; that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage as blood oozes through its skin and flows through the air to you, where it’s absorbed through your skin. For every 2 points of damage done to the target, you regain either 1 hit point or 1 sorcery point. The exsanguination continues, causing damage and restoring your hit points or sorcery points at the start of your turn, until you end it (no action required by you) or the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn.</p>

			<p>When cast on a dead or undead body, as you were returns that creature to the appearance it had in life while it was healthy and uninjured. The target must have a physical body; the spell fails automatically if the target is normally noncorporeal (banshee, ghost, wraith, et al.).</p>
			<p class="indent">If as you were is cast on a corpse, its effect is identical to gentle repose except that the corpse’s appearance is restored to that of a healthy, uninjured (albeit dead) person.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target is an undead creature, it also is restored to the appearance it had in life, even if it died from disease or from severe wounds, or centuries ago. The target looks, smells, and sounds (if it can talk) as it did in life. Friends and family can tell something is wrong only with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC, and only if they have reason to be suspicious (knowing the person should be dead is sufficient reason). Spells and abilities that detect undead are also fooled, but the creature remains susceptible to Turn Undead as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell doesn’t confer speech on undead that normally can’t speak. The creature eats, drinks, and breathes as a living creature does; it can mimic sleep, but it has no more need for it than it had before. Any amount of radiant, necrotic, or Constitution damage immediately ends this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">If this spell is cast on an undead creature that isn’t your ally or under your control, it makes a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, you cut your hand and take 1d4 slashing damage that can’t be healed until you take a long rest. Then touch a construct; it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that are immune to charm can be affected by this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “attack the ghouls,” “block the bridge,” or “fetch that bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends itself.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also cause the construct to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each time the construct takes damage, it makes a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the construct is already under your control when the spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher score) for 4 hours. The construct is capable of acting independently, though it remains loyal to you for the spell’s duration. You can also grant the target a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier on one skill in which you have proficiency.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>

Predators and creatures that feed on blood, including undead such as vampires, within 60 feet must make Charisma saving throws. Creatures with Keen Smell or any similar scent‑boosting ability have disadvantage on the saving throw, while undead that feed on blood have advantage on the saving throw. Those that fail are drawn toward the blood; they must move toward it unless impeded.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once an affected creature reaches the blood, it tries to consume it, foregoing all other actions while the blood is present.

If your quarry moves to another plane, its trail ends without trace, but blood spoor picks up the trail again if the caster shifts to the same plane as the quarry before the spell expires.</p>

			<p>You are surrounded by a field of glowing, blue energy lasting 3 rounds. Creatures within 5 feet of you throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained; a restrained creature whose saving throw fails is paralyzed; and a paralyzed creature whose saving throw fails is petrified and transforms into a statue of blue crystal. As with all concentration spells, you can end the field at any time (no action required). If you turn to crystal, the energy field ends after all affected creatures make their saving throws. Restrained and paralyzed creatures recover immediately when the spell effect ends, but petrification is permanent.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crystal creatures can see, hear, and smell normally, but they don’t need to eat or breathe. If shatter is cast on a crystal creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or be killed. If a crystal statue is broken or damaged, the subject has similar damage when its petrification ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures transformed into blue crystal can be restored with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.</p>

			<p>Doom of the cracked shield is cast on a melee weapon.

		<description>
			<p>When you cast doom of dancing blades, you create 1d4 illusory copies of your weapon that float in the air 5 feet from you. These images move with you, spinning, shifting, and mimicking your attacks. When you are hit by a melee attack but the attack roll was within 3 of your armor class, one illusory weapon parries the attack; you take no damage and the illusory weapon is destroyed. When you are hit by a melee attack that an illusory weapon can’t parry (the attack roll succeeds by 4 or more), you take only half damage from the attack and an illusory weapon is destroyed. Spells and effects that don’t require an attack roll or that affect an area affect you normally and don’t destroy any illusory weapons.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you make a melee attack that scores a critical hit while doom of dancing blades is in effect on you, all your illusory dancing blades also strike the target and do 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) each.</p>
			<p class="indent">An attacker must be able to see the illusory weapons to be affected. The spell has no effect if you are invisible or in total darkness, or on blind creatures.</p>

		<supports>Antipaladin</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast doom of disenchantment, your armor and shield glow with unholy light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any augmenting magic granting the attack a bonus to hit (but not advantage) or bonus damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical but it gets neither +1 to hit nor damage against a target under a doom of disenchantment. The doom also momentarily suppresses other magical abilities or spell-like abilities of the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause ongoing wounds on you and you recover hit points normally. If the attack was a spell or spell-like ability, it’s affected as if you’d cast counterspell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The ground within 30 feet of the point you designate turns into filthy and slippery muck, so that those in the area sink down to a watery death. This spell affects sand, earth, mud, or ice, but not stone, wood, or other material. For the duration, the ground in the affected area is difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the mud until the spell ends. A restrained creature can free itself by using an action to make a successful Strength saving throw. Creatures that free themselves or that enter the area after the spell was cast are affected by the difficult terrain but don’t become restrained.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each round, a restrained creature sinks deeper into the muck. A Medium or smaller creature that is restrained for 3 rounds becomes completely submerged at the end of its third turn. A Large creature becomes submerged after 4 rounds. Submerged creatures begin suffocating if they aren’t holding their breath. Creatures that are still submerged when the spell expires are sealed beneath the newly-solid ground. At that point, they can escape only if someone else digs them out or they have a burrowing speed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You drink a dose of venom or other poison and through the unholy power of your dark god, you spread the effect to other living things around you. If the poison normally allows a saving throw, you fail it automatically. You suffer the effect of the poison normally before spreading the poison to all other living creatures within 10 feet of you. Instead of making the usual saving throw against the poison, creatures around you make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. A target whose saving throw succeeds suffers no damage or other effect from the poison and is immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours. Targets that fail the saving throw don’t take the poison’s usual effect; instead, they take 14 (4d6) poison damage and are poisoned. While poisoned this way, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. On a failure, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is still poisoned. On a success, it’s no longer poisoned and it’s immune to further castings of doom of serpent coils for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">Multiple castings of doom of serpent coils have no additional effect against creatures that are already poisoned by it. The effect can also be ended by protection from poison or comparable magic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you open a glowing portal into the plane of shadow. The portal remains open for 1 minute, until 10 creatures step through it, or until you collapse it (no action required). Stepping through the portal places you on a shadow road leading to a destination within 50 miles, or in a direction specified by you. The road is in ideal condition. You and your companions can travel it safely at a normal pace, but you can’t rest on the road; if you stop for more than 10 minutes, the spell expires and dumps you back into the real world at a random spot within 10 miles of your starting point.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell expires 2d6 hours after being cast. When that happens, travelers on the road are safely deposited near their specified destination or 50 miles from their starting point in the direction that was specified when the spell was cast. Travelers never incur exhaustion no matter how many hours they spent walking or riding on the shadow road. The temporary shadow road ceases to exist; anything left behind is lost in the shadow realm. Each casting of St. Parvalas’s risen road creates a new shadow road.</p>
			<p class="indent">A small chance exists that a temporary shadow road might intersect with an existing shadow road, opening the possibility for meeting other travelers or monsters, or for choosing a different destination midjourney. The likelihood is entirely up to the GM. See the Midgard Campaign Setting for further details on shadow roads.</p>

			<p>The target’s blood coagulates rapidly, so that a dying target stabilizes and any ongoing bleeding or wounding effect on the target ends. The target can’t be the source of blood for any spell or effect that requires even a drop of blood.</p>

			<p>You call on the power of the dark gods of the afterlife to strengthen the target’s undead energy. The spell’s target has advantage on saving throws against Turn Undead while the spell lasts.</p>
			<p class="indent">If this spell is cast on a corpse that died from darakhul fever, the corpse gains a +5 bonus on its roll to determine whether it rises as a darakhul (see the darakhul entry in Tome of Beasts).</p>

			<p>You call forth a swirling, crackling wave of constantly shifting pops, flashes, and swept-up debris. This chaos can confound one creature. If the target creature fails a Wisdom saving throw, roll 1d4 and consult the table below to determine the result. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the spell expires after 3 rounds.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that’s within 30 feet of you and that sees you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that fails claws savagely at its eyes, doing (1d6 + the creature’s Strength modifier) piercing damage, is stunned until the end of its next turn, and is blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the d6) is blinded permanently.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You perform a ritual that marks one unattended magic item (including weapons and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The exact appearance of the bloodstain is up to you. The item’s magical abilities don’t function for anyone else as long as the bloodstain remains on it. For example, a +1 flaming longsword with a vital mark functions as a nonmagical longsword in the hands of anyone but the caster, but it still functions as a +1 flaming longsword for the caster who placed the bloodstain on it. A wand of magic missiles would be no more than a stick in the hands of anyone but the vital mark’s caster.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher on the same item for 28 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent until dispelled.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Upon casting this spell, your jaws distend and dozens of thin, slimy tentacles emerge from your mouth to grasp and bind your opponents. Make a melee spell attack against a foe within 15 feet of you. On a hit the target takes (2d6 + your Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC = your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and it takes (2d6 + your Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns. You can grapple only one creature at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tentacles can be attacked to free a grappled opponent. Their armor class equals yours. If they take (5 + your Constitution modifier) slashing damage from a single attack, enough tentacles are severed to free a grappled opponent. Severed tentacles are replaced by new ones at the start of your turn. Damage done to the tentacles doesn’t affect your hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the spell is in effect, you are incapable of speech and can’t cast spells with verbal components.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, you inflict 1d4 slashing damage on yourself that can’t be healed until after the blade created by this spell is destroyed or the spell ends. The trickling blood transforms into a dagger of red metal that functions as a +1 dagger.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level, the self-inflicted wound deals 3d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +2 dagger.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the self-inflicted wound does 9d4 slashing damage and the spell produces a +3 dagger of wounding.</p>
