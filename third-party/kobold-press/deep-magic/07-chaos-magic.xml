			<p><strong>Unleash the Madness!</strong></p>
			<p>The ability to channel and manipulate raw arcane power does not belong to sorcerers alone. A few wizards and bards have learned to dominate the chaotic energy of change itself, leading them along a narrow path that circles a pit of madness. Cling to the path, and avoid slipping into that roiling pit, and you will be rewarded with the power to alter reality through strength of will alone.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Chaos Magic brings the secrets of chaos magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new Chaos Magic wizard school and a bardic College of Entropy</li>
				<li>A random Chaos Magic Surge table, for those times when reality gets away from you</li>
				<li>17 new spells, including shifting the odds, entropic damage field, chaotic form, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whether you’re a wizard skirting the edge of madness, or a thrill-seeking bard who follows the path of the luck stealer, you live for unpredictability and danger. In fact, sometimes you feel more at home in the dungeon than at the inn...</p>
			<p>Harness the power of chaos today!</p>

			<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature with a number of hit dice no greater than your level and at least 1 hp. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, you and the creature’s current hit point totals change. Roll d100 and increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit Point Flux table. Apply that result to both yourself and the target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1 round/caster level.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, assume a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has 17 of her maximum 30 hp casts chaotic vitality on a creature with 58 hp and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of (17 + 54 =) 71 hp. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get 50% of the total, so the spellcaster and the target end up with 35 hp each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of those hp are temporary and will last 3 rounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum hit dice of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
			<p><strong>HIT POINT FLUX</strong></p>

			<p>You throw a handful of colored cloth into the air while screaming a litany of disjointed phrases. A moment later, a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range fills with multicolored light, cacophonous sound, overpowering scents, and other confusing sensory information. The effect is dizzying and overwhelming. All enemies within the cube must make successful Intelligence saving throws or be blinded, deafened, and fall prone. They cannot stand up or recover from this blindness or deafness while within the area of effect, but the conditions and the restriction on standing end immediately for a creature who leaves the spell’s area of effect.</p>

			<p>By twisting a length of silver wire around your finger, you tie your fate to those around you. When you take damage, that damage is divided equally between you and all creatures in range who fail a Charisma saving throw. Any leftover damage that can’t be divided equally is taken by you. Creatures are allowed a fresh saving throw against this spell each time you take damage, and a success ends the spell’s effect on that creature. Creatures that approach to within 60 feet of you after the spell was cast are affected.</p>

			<p>You channel the force of chaos to taint your target’s mind. A target that fails to make a successful Wisdom saving throw must roll 1d20 and consult the Alignment Fluctuation table to find its new alignment, and it must roll anew every minute of the spell’s duration. The target’s alignment stops fluctuating and returns to normal when the spell ends. These changes do not, in and of themselves, make the affected creature friendly or hostile toward the caster, but they can cause creatures to behave in unpredictable ways.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You direct a bolt of rainbow colors toward a creature of your choice within range. If it hits, the target takes 3d8 damage of a random type (determined by rolling on the Damage Type table; see Twisted Arcana). If your attack roll was odd (the roll itself, not the adjusted result), the bolt leaps to a new target of your choice within range that has not already been targeted by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even number on your spell attack, miss a target, or run out of potential targets. All targets must be within range from you. You and your allies are legal targets for this spell, if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create an additional bolt for each slot level above 2nd. Each potential target can be hit only once by the spell, not once per bolt.</p>
