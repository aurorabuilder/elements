			<p><strong>Magic that Soars, Flows, Burns, and Crushes!</strong></p>
			<p>Primal forces seethe beyond the boundaries of the world, in planes where the four elements clash and vie with each other for dominion. Air howls free and swift! Earth stands indomitable and unyielding! Fire rages unchecked! Water ebbs and flows!</p>
			<p>Some mortals carry a spark of elemental magic in their very souls, while those who study arcane lore bend its secrets to their will. Others—out of desperation or arrogance—strike bargains with beings of unfathomable power from the Elemental Planes.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Elemental Magic brings the secrets of elemental magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Elemental Essence sorcerous origin, the Genie Lord warlock patron, and an Elementalism arcane tradition for wizards</li>
				<li>Two new elemental magic feats: Negotiator and Survivor</li>
				<li>17 new spells, including rolling thunder, flame wave, caustic torrent, and spire of stone</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Channeling the primal forces of creation is a dangerous calling, but its power is like none other. Let your mortal form be the conduit for these planar energies, and unleash the fury of the elements on your foes!</p>

			<p>You have honed the knack of the deal and counter offer, perhaps by crossing words with creatures used to getting the upper hand in negotiations. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>When you attempt to convince a creature to engage in a course of action or to change its attitude with a Charisma (Persuasion) check and fail, you can retry the check on your next turn with disadvantage.</li>
				<li>When you purchase a good or service, you can attempt an opposed Charisma (Persuasion) check versus the seller’s Wisdom (Insight). If you win the contest, you secure a 10 percent discount on the transaction. Once you use this feature on a given individual, you can’t use it on them again for one week.</li>

			<p>Your innate magic arises from elemental power suffused into your being. You might have an elemental creature, such as genie, in your ancestry. Perhaps you lived most of your life near a portal to one of the Elemental Planes, and the ambient magic of the plane saturated everything you ate and drank. Perhaps a magical conjuring went awry, and the essence of an elemental merged with your own. Whatever the ultimate source, you are a walking conduit to an elemental plane.</p>

			<p>At 14th level, you can teleport by skimming the outer boundary of the Elemental Planes. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you appear, you can, depending on your heritage element, create the following effects:</p>

All creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage and be blinded by dust and debris until the start of your next turn.</li>
				<li><strong>Earth.</strong> When you appear within 5 feet of nonmagical, unworked stone filling at least one five-foot square, you create tremors in the earth that ripple outward from you. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is touching the ground must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.</li>
				<li><strong>Fire.</strong> When you appear within 5 feet of a fire at least the size of a campfire, you create a burst of flame around yourself. Each creature within 10 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and ignite. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.</li>
				<li><strong>Water.</strong> When you appear within 5 feet of at least 50 gallons of water, you create a torrent of water that assails the creatures around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and choke on the water that forces its way into the creature’s throat. A choking creature can’t speak and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn. Creatures that don’t have to breathe or that can breathe water don’t choke.</li>

			<p>Some spells resonate with your focus element. They might deal the associated damage type, manipulate the element in question, or otherwise embody an elemental theme. Work with your GM to determine whether a given spell resonates with your focus. The gold and time you must spend to copy a spell resonant with your chosen element into your spellbook is halved. When you gain a level, one of the two spells you learn for gaining a level can be an elemental magic spell even if you’ve never encountered the spell before.

			<p>A howling storm of thick snow and ice crystals appears in a 40-foot wide, 40-foot high cylinder. The area is heavily obscured by swirling snow. When the storm appears, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when it enters the area for the first time or ends its turn there.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature who takes cold damage from this spell has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration until the start of its next turn.</p>

			<p>A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you choose. The acid fills a line that is 60-foot long and 5-foot wide. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. The line releases toxic fumes, and each creature other than you within 5 feet of the line is poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

			<p>You cause slabs of rock to burst out of the ground or another stone surface to form a 10-foot cube within range. When the cube forms, a creature inside must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be trapped in the stone tomb. The tomb is airtight, with enough air for a single Medium or Small creature to breathe for 8 hours. Divide the time evenly between the number of creatures trapped within. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures. If the creature is still trapped inside when the air runs out, it begins to suffocate.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tomb has an AC 18 and 50 hit points. It is resistant to fire, cold, lightning, bludgeoning, and slashing damage, is immune to poison and psychic damage, and is vulnerable to thunder damage. When reduced to 0 hit points, the tomb crumbles into harmless powder.</p>

			<p>You point toward an area of ground or similar surface within range. A geyser of lava erupts from the spot you choose, creating a 5-foot wide, 40-foot high cylinder of lava centered on a point you can see. When it erupts, any creature either in the area or that starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the start of your turn, the lava spreads in a pool centered at the base of the geyser. The first time it spreads, it creates a 10-foot radius of lava, and the radius increases by 10 feet each subsequent round to a maximum radius of 50 feet. Creatures who start their turn in the pool take 5d8 fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Lava clings to a creature when it leaves the area, and it hardens into stone. The creature is reduced to half speed and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until a creature uses an action to break the hardened lava off. If you maintain your concentration for the full minute, the lava geyser and pool permanently harden into nonmagical stone. A creature in the hardened stone is restrained. The stone has an AC 17, 25 hit points, is resistant to all damage except thunder, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. A restrained creature can break free as an action with a successful DC 27 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
