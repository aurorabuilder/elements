			<p><strong>Distill the Essence of Magic!</strong></p>
			<p>Magical elements and potions attuned to greater forces—these are the building blocks of the perenially-underestimated alkemancers! Fusing arcane acid with pure fire, with essences of life and death, those Eastern alchemists who understand the material world can better manipulate it through arcane means. From breath and pure waters, from crucibles and flasks, you have learned to mix and master liquid power, secrets of the lab now ready to unleash on your foes. The 20 pages of Deep Magic: Alkemancy bring the secrets of alchemy into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new Alkemancy tradition for wizards, with mastery of essences and mutability of existing magical effects</li>
				<li>the 6 legendary elixirs of alkemancy, each a potion of mythic power: Black, Golden, Iron, Jade, Pearl, and Ruby elixirs</li>
				<li>18 magical items and mundane tools, from the alembic of unmaking and brain juice to swarm repellants and alchemical ice!</li>
				<li>20 new spells, including brimstone infusion, acid gate, bottled arcana, quicksilver mantle, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your work with brimstone and salt, quicksilver and gold yields surprising results to those who think of alchemy as a matter of peddling potions. Your philosophy and understanding of life and the arcane grants you insight, and that insight can be translated into creations of vast power! Those who understand the fundamental nature of the world can change that nature to suit their will.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The yellow of brimstone (otherwise known as sulfur) represents activity, energy, and masculinity, and it’s related to the sun, volcanoes, and elemental fire. Brimstone is a destructive essence present in small amounts in explosives, various acids, and in substances such as alchemist’s fire.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also erroneously referred to as antimony (a different metal that lead is sometimes combined with), lead represents coldness and heaviness, transformation, and the removal of impurities in objects and creatures. It is associated with broader elemental metals and is often called the oldest or first metal. Lead is reactive and can be toxic in various forms over long periods of exposure— useful qualities in lingering poisons and slowacting corrosives. It’s used as a component in many alchemical creations and supplies.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also known as mercury, this silvery metal represents passivity, femininity, and malleability. It’s associated with elemental water and the moon. Quicksilver is seen as a creative essence despite its passive nature. It’s also a lethal poison, being much faster-acting than lead, for example. One fluid dram of refined quicksilver is occasionally used in vials of both alchemical poisons and antitoxins.</p>

		<description>
			<p>One of the rarest and most mysterious of the six fundamental essences, quintessence represents thought, life, and spirit. It is distantly but usefully related to elemental air; in its commonest form, it appears as a vaporous silvery liquid. Quintessence is never used in common alchemical items, largely because it’s one of the most difficult of the essences to obtain and it tends to dissipate as soon as it’s exposed to air. Alkemancers are always keen to find viable substitutes for quintessence in their concoctions.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The most common of the six fundamental essences is salt, which represents matter, physicality, and the human body. It is closely related to elemental earth. Purified salt is used in many common alchemical items, and solutions of salt are used widely in mundane and supernatural formulas and rituals.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Formed from the blood of slain voidlings (vile monsters described in the Tome of Beasts), void salt is formed of small, dull black crystals; it takes its name from this granular appearance. Void salt is associated with dissolution, entropy, and madness. It is a dangerous substance to work with, because merely touching it with bare skin causes 1 necrotic damage. Anyone intending to work with void salt should wear gloves of metal or thick leather, and even those substances corrode soon after coming in contact with void salt unless they’re protected with an anti-necrotic energy coating. The use of void salt is reserved for rare alchemical concoctions, mainly acids, poisons, and explosives.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Wizards who combine traditional spellcasting with advanced alchemical practices and concoctions are called alkemancers. They are a mysterious breed sometimes confused with transmuters, with whom they share a complicated rivalry. Unlike the majority of transmuters, who focus on the physical transformation of objects and creatures, alkemancers are concerned with the search for human perfection and immortality and they use alchemy as a means in this pursuit. Still, there is much crossover between the two traditions. Alkemancers and transmuters can be found working toward the same goals, as both allies and rivals.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alkemancy spells typically blend conjuration, necromancy, and transmutation effects. Few alkemancy spells belong to the schools of evocation or illusion, since spells of these schools summon energy out of nothingness or create things that are not real; both concepts are at odds with the precepts of alkemancy, which seeks to reduce energy and matter to its constituent parts and refine them to a more purified (or useful) state of existence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Except as noted below, alkemancers function as wizards and use the wizard spell list.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can add one of the six fundamental essences to your spells as an additional material component at the cost of 1 gp per spell level. This doesn’t increase the casting time of the spell or any of its other effects except as follows.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding brimstone to a spell that deals fire damage causes the flames to take on a bluish hue and to release irritating vapors. A creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</li>
				<li>Adding lead to a spell that improves your armor class, such as mage armor or shield, increases the spell’s AC bonus by 2. If the spell has a duration longer than 1 round, the duration also increases by a number of additional rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Any visible spell effect modified with lead takes on a dull gray sheen.</li>
				<li>Adding quicksilver to a spell that changes the form of a creature or an object, such as alter self or polymorph, increases the spell’s duration by a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Spells with a duration briefer than 10 minutes, such as alchemical form, measure the increase in rounds instead of minutes. Any change in form modified with quicksilver is always accompanied by lustrous wisps or motes of silvery energy.</li>
				<li>Adding quintessence to a necromantic spell that grants temporary hit points, such as false life or life hack, increases the temporary hit points gained by a number equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). Adding quintessence to a spell doesn’t change the spell’s visible aspects.</li>
				<li>Adding salt to a spell that deals acid damage gives the acid a pale, crystalline hue and causes it to become extremely painful. Any creature damaged by the spell must also make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 points from its Strength and Dexterity scores (rolled separately). These lost points return automatically after a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</li>
				<li>Adding void salt to a spell that deals necrotic damage causes the spell to shed palpable strands of darkness. Any creature damaged by the spell is also surrounded by a veil of cloying shadows and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be restrained for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).</li>

		<supports>Alkemancy Magic</supports>
		<description>
			<p>By touching an empty, stoppered glass container such as a vial or flask, you magically enable it to hold a single spell. To be captured, the spell must be cast within one round of casting bottled arcana and it must be intentionally cast into the container. The container can hold one spell of up to 3rd level. The spell is held in the container until it’s released or 24 hours have passed. After 24 hours, the container reverts to a mundane vessel and any magic still inside it dissipates harmlessly.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, any creature can unstop the container, thereby releasing the spell within. If the spell has a range of self, the creature opening the container is affected; otherwise, the creature opening the container designates the target according to the contained spell’s description. If a creature opens the container unwittingly (it doesn’t know the container holds a spell), the spell targets the creature opening the container or is centered on its space (whichever is more appropriate) instead. Dispel magic cast on the container targets bottled arcana, not the spell inside. If bottled arcana is dispelled, the container becomes inert and the spell inside dissipates harmlessly.</p>
			<p class="indent">Until the spell in the container is released, its caster can’t regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. Once the spell is released, its caster can regain the use of that slot normally.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the level of the spell the container can hold increases by one for every slot level above 5th.</p>

		<supports>Alkemancy Magic</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to consume dangerous substances and contain them in an extradimensional reservoir in your stomach. The spell allows you to swallow most liquids, such as acids, alcohol, poison, and even quicksilver, and hold them safely in your stomach. You are unaffected by swallowing the substance, but the spell doesn’t give you resistance or immunity to the substance in general; for example, you could safely drink a bucket of a black dragon’s acidic spittle, but you’d still be burned if you were caught in the dragon’s breath attack or if that bucket of acid were dumped over your head.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell allows you to store up to 10 gallons of liquid at one time. The liquid doesn’t need to all be of the same type, and different types don’t mix while in your stomach. Any liquid in excess of 10 gallons has its normal effect when you try to swallow it.</p>
			<p class="indent">At any time before you stop concentrating on the spell, you can regurgitate up to 1 gallon of liquid stored in your stomach as a bonus action. The liquid is vomited into an adjacent 5-foot square. A target in that square must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the liquid. The GM determines the exact effect based on the type of liquid regurgitated, using 1d6 damage of the appropriate type as the baseline.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you stop concentrating on the spell, its duration expires, or it’s dispelled, the extradimensional reservoir and the liquid it contains simply cease to exist.</p>

If your ranged spell attack was a critical hit or exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more, the Strength saving throw is made with disadvantage.

		<description>
			<p>This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes emit bright, amethyst sparks.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won’t physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a short sword or a cloak) can’t be dissolved this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item’s magical energy takes an hour, but ten minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical.</p>
			<p class="indent">If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling graypurple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10% per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.</p>
			<p class="indent">The alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item per 24 hours.</p>

	<element name="Anuraag’s Crucible" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Alkemancy" id="ID_KBP_DMA_MAGIC_ITEM_ANURAAGS_CRUCIBLE">
		<description>
			<p>Thousands of years ago, a powerful alkemancer named Anuraag constructed an enormous crucible in his quest to create the perfect organism. He hoped it would bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the bottom of a mighty chasm.</p>
			<p class="indent">Anuraag's crucible is an enormous object fashioned from white clay and engraved with mystical symbols chased with burnished copper and electrum. The crucible is large enough to hold a single Huge creature, two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, etc.</p>
			<p class="indent">If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw against the crucible’s powerful transmutation magic. If this saving throw fails, the creature’s body liquefies and the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the transformation is complete. Their equipment doesn't dissolve along with them, though most creatures are stripped naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into another creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its original form by a resurrection spell or comparable magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the process reaches completion, the creature transforms into another creature as if affected by a shapechange spell. The transformed creature must make a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features, which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly-born version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly-assumed form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain its former form (and memories and abilities) only via wish or comparable magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Constructs and undead are immune to the crucible’s power, as is any creature that can change its shape at will, such as a doppelganger.</p>
			<p class="indent">To determine what a creature transforms into, roll 1d20.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures such as aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, they are infused with magical power and regain 1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. If the saving throw fails, they are afflicted with a short-term madness lasting 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, they gain a permanent long-term madness and automatically fail all further Intelligence saving throws caused by drinking brain juice.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This long, thin retort is fashioned from smoky yellow glass and is topped with an intricately carved brass stopper.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can unstopper the retort and fill it with liquid as an action. Once you do so, it spews out multicolored bubbles in a 20-foot radius. The bubbles last 1d4 + 1 rounds. While they last, creatures within the radius are blinded and the area is heavily obscured to all creatures except those with tremorsense. The liquid in the retort is destroyed in the process with no harmful effect on its surroundings. If any bubbles are popped, they burst with a wet smacking sound but no other effect.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This wide leather girdle has many sewn-in pouches and holsters that hold an assortment of empty beakers and vials. Once you’ve attuned to the girdle, these containers magically fill with the following liquids:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 flasks of alchemist’s fire;</li>
				<li>2 flasks of alchemist’s ice;</li>
				<li>2 vials of acid;</li>
				<li>2 jars of swarm repellent;</li>
				<li>1 vial of assassin’s blood poison;</li>
				<li>1 potion of climbing;</li>
				<li>1 potion of healing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Each container magically replenishes each day at dawn, if you are wearing the girdle. All the potions and alchemical substances produced by the girdle of traveling alchemy lose their useful properties if they’re transferred to another container before being used.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy brown fluid contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. The oily substance can coat one weapon or up to five pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. Once applied, the coated weapon or ammunition deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures with every successful strike for the next hour.</p>
			<p class="indent">The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, helpless, or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the substance causes 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Alkemancers have mastered the craft of condensing potions into pills. Potions in pill form have the same effect as regular potions and have the same color as they potions they’re derived from, but an individual pill has effectively no weight and can be concealed very easily in boots, pouches, hatbands, or secret pockets. A potion in pill form costs five times as much as the regular version of the potion, but a pill can be swallowed as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">A pill isn’t affected by the freeze potion spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over your skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive‑green scales like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for 1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn’t combine with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
			<p class="indent">A jar of scalehide cream contains 1d6 + 1 doses.</p>

	<element name="Black Elixir" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Alkemancy" id="ID_KBP_DMA_MAGIC_ITEM_BLACK_ELIXIR">
		<description>
			<p>This greasy black liquid acts as a poison when drunk or rubbed on flesh. Its unfortunate or foolish user takes 12d6 poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">Its true power is revealed, however, when black elixir is smeared on a doorway or other portal; the magical oil acts as a forbiddance spell with a duration of one year. Unlike the spell, black elixir doesn't incorporate a password and only affects celestials and fiends. Typically, the creator of the elixir determines when the elixir is created whether the forbiddance effect deals radiant or necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong> The heart of a marut, the powdered horn of a ki-rin, and a vial of black mud taken from the bottom of a lake that at least one celestial or fiend has bathed in.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The most famous of the six elixirs is this thick, golden, syrupy liquid that grants its imbiber eternal life. The potion completely stops the aging process and renders the imbiber immune to all natural and magical diseases and poisons. The drinker can still be harmed or killed through other methods such as violence, but the march of time no longer holds any threat over him or her.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong> A thimble of distilled sunlight, the breath of a solar, and the hair of a venerable sage who is at least 100 years old.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This dark, grainy liquid tastes positively awful. Anyone imbibing the elixir gains permanent resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and gains a damage threshold of 5, but their speed is reduced by 10 feet and they always make Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity ability checks with disadvantage that can’t be overcome or canceled out by any means.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong> The core of an iron golem, a shard of purest adamantine, and the powdered teeth of a mountain giant.</p>

The drinker always has advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with extraplanar creatures, and when calling or conjuring one of the selected creatures, it arrives with maximum hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong> The tears of an invisible stalker, the claw of a pit fiend, and the tongue of a bard of at least 10th level.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This silvery-white elixir has a variety of effects depending on whether it is drunk, rubbed on a creature's feet, or smeared on the hull of a boat. If drunk, the elixir confers the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the ability to walk on water as if wearing a ring of water walking. If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are permanent.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong> The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.</p>

	<element name="Alchemist’s Ice" type="Item" source="Deep Magic: Alkemancy" id="ID_KBP_DMA_ITEM_ALCHEMISTS_ICE">
		<description>
			<p>This blue-white flask is cool to the touch because it contains a volatile liquid that turns to ice when exposed to air. If the flask is poured over a surface, it creates a 5-foot patch of ice that functions as regular ice for movement purposes. The flask can be thrown at a creature like a flask of alchemist's fire; if it hits, it does 1d8 cold damage and the creature must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alchemist's ice was invented by alkemancers in the tropics as a way of keeping their food and drinks cold, and many restaurants and taverns still use it for this purpose. A vial of alchemist's ice costs 50 gp.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The head of this arrow is fitted with a syringe that can be filled with liquid. When it strikes a creature, the arrow does 1d4 piercing damage plus the effect of whatever liquid the syringe injects into the creature. Poisons are common, as are acid, drugs, and various eclectic potions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Hypodermic arrows are extremely fragile; they always break on impact, whether they hit the target or miss. A single hypodermic arrow costs 25 gp. They’re always sold empty, but those found in treasure hauls or among monsters’ gear might be charged. Filling the syringe takes an action but it can be done hours or days before the arrow is used.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This slimy, yellow paste can be smeared over exposed parts of the body to protect against attacks by insect swarms. A swarm of ants, beetles, biting flies, wasps, or similar insects that enters your space while you’re protected by swarm repellent must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be unable to attack you. A repelled swarm can repeat this saving throw at the start of its turn; most swarms prefer to seek out an unprotected target.</p>
			<p class="indent">A jar of swarm repellent costs 40 gp and holds enough paste to protect two Medium or four Small creatures. Applying the repellent takes 1 minute, so it’s not a good option in the middle of combat, but it’s effective for 1 hour or until you’re immersed in water.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A tooth capsule is a false tooth that contains a dose of ingested poison (5d6 poison damage, DC 15 Constitution save for half) or some other potion in pill form: a sleeping pill or a pill of invisibility are also common. To activate the tooth capsule, you simply bite down on it as a bonus action and make a DC 10 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the capsule shatters and releases the pill, which you can then swallow, hold in your mouth, or spit out.</p>
			<p class="indent">Determining whether a tooth in someone else’s mouth is a tooth capsule takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. Obviously, the creature must be restrained, unconscious, paralyzed, or cooperative.</p>
			<p class="indent">Tooth capsules are favored by spies and operatives of fanatical organizations who are willing to die rather than allow their secrets to be captured by their enemies. They are illegal in some countries and cultures but usually are available on the black market for 100 gp plus the cost of whatever potion they’re loaded with. The pill loaded in the tooth capsule isn’t interchangeable, and these are good for only one use (obviously).</p>
