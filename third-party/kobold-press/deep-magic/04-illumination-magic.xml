			<p><strong>Masters of Starlight and Shadow</strong></p>
			<p>As you gaze up at the night sky, you hear your companions whisper—some of them anxious, some mocking, yet none comprehending. For in the shifting patterns of the stars, you read the fate of gods and mortals. And out of the shadow between them, you shape spells to ravage and destroy your foes.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Illumination brings the secrets of illumination magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Illumination school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Omen of Warning, Master of the Endless Night, and Comprehension of the Starry Sky</li>
				<li>21 new spells, including compelling fate, icy grasp of the ether, shadow trove, summon star, and more</li>
				<li>A new Star and Shadow feat that grants darkvision, the ability to ignore resistance to necrotic or radiant damage, and free use of augury between long rests</li>
				<li>An enigmatic new NPC, the illuminator Talithe Val’Shiar</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the slow, majestic movements of the heavens, you see a future fraught with terrible danger—but also, great opportunity. Use this knowledge well, illuminator, for it may be your greatest weapon…</p>

			<p>Members of the School of Illumination, called illuminators, use the stars to predict when danger is near, and draw on the power of darkness to atack their foes. This school is popular with delvers into the underworld, because its spells work best where light is dim or absent.</p>

			<p>Starting at 14th level, during a long rest you can consult the stars and comprehend some meaning in a cosmic event. The stars must be visible to you for you to use this ability.

			<p class="indent"><strong>Eclipse.</strong> Eclipses plunge the world into darkness and strengthen connections to the shadow plane. Then you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that causes necrotic damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You summon a seething sphere of dark energy 5 feet in diameter. The sphere pulls creatures toward it and devours the life force of those it envelops. Every creature other than you that starts its turn within 90 feet of the black well must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pulled 50 feet toward the well. A creature pulled into the well takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is stunned; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and reduces the stun to incapacitation. A creature that starts its turn inside the well also makes a Constitution saving throw; the creature is stunned on a failure or incapacitated on a success. An incapacitated creature that leaves the well recovers immediately and can take actions and reactions that turn. Creatures take damage only upon entering the well—they take no additional damage for remaining in it—but if they leave the well and are pulled back in again, they take damage again. A total of nine Medium creatures, three Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be inside the well’s upper-dimensional space at one time. Then the well’s duration ends, all creatures inside it tumble out in a heap, landing prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage done by the well increases by 1d8 and the well pulls creatures an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 6th.</p>

			<p>You paint a small door approximately 2 feet square on a hard surface to create a portal into the void of space. The portal “peels of ” the surface you painted it on and follows you when you move, always loating in the air within 5 feet of you. An icy chill lows out from the portal. You can place up to 750 pounds of nonliving mater through the portal, where it stays suspended in the frigid void until you withdraw it. Items that are still inside the shadow trove when the duration ends are lost forever. You can designate a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier who have access to the shadow trove; only you and those creatures can move objects through the portal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 2 hours for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

			<p>You wrap yourself in a protective shroud of the night sky made from swirling shadows punctuated with twinkling motes of light. The shroud grants you resistance against either radiant or necrotic damage (choose when the spell is cast). You also shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.</p>

			<p>You create a shadow play against a screen or wall. The surface can encompass up to 100 square feet. The number of creatures that can see the shadow play equals your Intelligence score. The shadowy igures make no sound but they can dance, run, move, kiss, ight, and so forth. Most of the figures are generic types—a rabbit, a dwarf—but a number of them equal to your Intelligence modifier can be recognizable as specific individuals.</p>

			<p>You momentarily become a shadow (a humanoidshaped absence of light, not the undead creature of that name). You can slide under a door, through a keyhole, or through any other tiny opening. All of your equipment is transformed with you, and you can move up to your full speed during the spell’s duration. While in this form you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in darkness or dim light and you are immune to all damage except force, psychic, or radiant. You can dismiss this spell early by using an action to do so.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you return to your normal form while in a space too small for you (such as a mouse hole, sewer pipe, or the like), you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest space big enough to hold you within 50 feet. If the distance is greater than 50 feet, you take 1d6 extra force damage for every additional 10 feet traveled.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an additional willing creature that you can touch for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>This spell increases gravity tenfold within a 50-foot radius of you. All creatures in the area other than you drop whatever they’re holding in their hands, fall prone, become incapacitated, and can’t move. If some solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when lying or levitating creatures fall, they take triple the normal falling damage. Any creature besides you that enters or starts its turn in the area must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. Failure means the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; success means the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage but it’s no longer incapacitated and it can move at half-speed. All ranged weapon atacks inside the area of effect have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles with mass, such as a laming sphere. Creatures under the inluence of a reedom of movement spell or comparable magic have advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and their speed isn’t reduced once they recover from incapacitation.</p>

			<p>You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 90 feet and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long, white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed by the star repeats the Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. If successful, that creature is no longer charmed and is immune to the effect from this star. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a deva. It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and atacks the last creature that atacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
