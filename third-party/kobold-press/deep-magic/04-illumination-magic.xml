			<p><strong>Masters of Starlight and Shadow</strong></p>
			<p>As you gaze up at the night sky, you hear your companions whisper—some of them anxious, some mocking, yet none comprehending. For in the shifting patterns of the stars, you read the fate of gods and mortals. And out of the shadow between them, you shape spells to ravage and destroy your foes.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Illumination brings the secrets of illumination magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Illumination school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Omen of Warning, Master of the Endless Night, and Comprehension of the Starry Sky</li>
				<li>21 new spells, including compelling fate, icy grasp of the ether, shadow trove, summon star, and more</li>
				<li>A new Star and Shadow feat that grants darkvision, the ability to ignore resistance to necrotic or radiant damage, and free use of augury between long rests</li>
				<li>An enigmatic new NPC, the illuminator Talithe Val’Shiar</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the slow, majestic movements of the heavens, you see a future fraught with terrible danger—but also, great opportunity. Use this knowledge well, illuminator, for it may be your greatest weapon…</p>
