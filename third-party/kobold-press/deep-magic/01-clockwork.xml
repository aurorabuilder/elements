			<p><strong>The Universe is a Machine. Your Hand is On The Lever.</strong></p>
			<p>You’ve been trained to sense the movements of vast, invisible gears, and to wield the tools of making and dismantling. Your garments are smudged with oil and singed with fire; goggles protect your eyes from flying sparks and the sweat that pours from your brow as you labor in your workshop.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Clockwork brings the secrets of clockwork magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Clockwork domain for clerics, featuring Improved mending, Channel Magic, and Clockwork Apotheosis</li>
				<li>The Great Machine pact for warlocks, with three new invocations: cloud of cogs, heat of the furnace, and voice of the machine</li>
				<li>A Clockwork Mage school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Clockwork Savant, Clockworker’s Charm, Metal Shape, Golem Form, and Clockwork Mastery</li>
				<li>45 new and updated spells, including chains of the goddess, gear barrage, hellforging, robe of shards, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The magic of the gears is yours to control! Will you use it to uphold order, progress, and industry? Or grind your enemies under the ceaseless cogs of might…?</p>

		<description>
			<p>Rava, the Goddess of Gear, has blessed her followers with unusual powers, but she is not the only being in the multiverse that can grant the clockwork domain. Historical gods of blacksmiths such as Hephaestus/Vulcan, Govannon, or Gu can serve as patrons, as can mortals-turned-gods renowned for their engineering skill, like Daedalus. The emergence of clockworks in a society represents both a shit in magic and in thought, and the clockwork powers seek careful, dedicated, and unrelenting followers. They are guardians of order, progress, and industry. Some, the followers of evil gods, seek to grind everything under the ceaseless cogs of might, while followers of neutral or good clockwork gods seek instead to shape society under the belief that all beneit when everything works in harmony.</p>

		<supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The school of clockwork magic is a blending of technology and magic not oten seen. While some would argue that all spells of this so-called school are simply applications of the more traditionally acknowledged branches of arcane magic, the clockwork mages understand that there is qualitative diference in thought between casting, say, a clockwork (evocation) spell and an ordinary evocation. The school thrives alongside industry, using a small number of spells, compared to the older schools, to create a wide range of styles. Fool is he who fails to notice arcane glyphs and wands and mistakes a clockwork mage for a common gear grinder or tinkerer.</p>
			<p class="indent">Clockwork mages who use the spell find familiar (or others who gain access to the spell and choose to use it) substitute the material components for a small clockwork device in the form of an animal similar to those listed in the text of the spell. When the ritual is completed, magical animating force gives life to the device. The delicacy of the clockwork makes up for any superior durability of the materials. It has the statistics of the chosen form but is a construct instead of a beast. Unlike a normal familiar, the devices’ form cannot be changed without investing in the material components to rebuild it. The familiar is never counted when determining the number of constructs a mage can control.</p>

If the saving throw succeeds, you take 2d10 psychic damage plus 2d10 necrotic damage from waves of uncontrolled energy rippling out from the disembodied spirit. You can maintain the spell, forcing the subject to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, with the same consequence to you for each failure. If you choose not to maintain the spell or are unable to do so, the evil spirit returns to its place of torment and cannot be recalled.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the saving throw fails, the summoned spirit is transferred into the waiting soul gem and immediately animates the constructed body. The subject is now a hellforged; it loses all of its previous racial traits and gains gearforged traits except as follows:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vulnerability:</em></strong> Hellforged are vulnerable to radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Evil Mind:</em></strong> Hellforged have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and abilities of evil iends or aberrations that efect the mind or behavior.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Past Life:</em></strong> The hellforged retains only a vague sense of who it was in its former existence, but these memories are enough for it to gain proiciency in one skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages:</em></strong> Hellforged speak Common, Machine Speech, and Infernal or Abyssal</p>
			<p>Up to four other spellcasters of at least 5th level can assist you in the ritual. Each assistant increases the DC of the Charisma saving throw by 1. In the event of a failed saving throw, the spellcaster and each assistant take damage. An assistant who drops out of the casting can’t rejoin.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This ritual allows you to imbue a spell of 1st through 3rd level that has a casting time of instantaneous onto a gear worth 100 gp per level of spell you are imbuing. At the end of the ritual, the gear is placed into a piece of clockwork that includes a timer or trigger mechanism. When the timer or trigger goes of, the spell is cast. If the range of the spell was Touch, it efects only a target touching the device. If the spell had a range in feet, the spell is cast on the closest viable target within range, based on the nature of the spell. Spells with a range of Self or Sight can’t be imbued. If the gear is placed with a timer, it activates when the time elapses regardless of whether a legitimate target is available.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> You can perform this ritual as a 7th level spell to imbue a spell of 4th or 5th level.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You target a piece of metal equipment or a metal construct. If the target is a creature wearing metal armor or is a construct, it makes a Wisdom saving throw to negate the efect. If the saving throw fails, the spell makes metal cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This efectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unafected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not afected. Metal constructs are completely paralyzed. An afected creature or construct repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the efect on itself with a success, though constructs make this saving throw with disadvantage. A grease spell dispels lock armor on everything in its area of efect.</p>

			<p>You can take control of a construct by voice or mental commands. The construct makes a Wisdom saving throw to resist the spell, and it gets advantage on the saving throw if its CR equals or exceeds your level in the class used to cast this spell. Once a command is given, the construct does everything it can to complete the command. Giving a new command takes an action. Constructs will risk harm, even go into combat, on your orders but will not self-destruct; giving such an order ends the spell.</p>

			<p>You call upon the dark blessings of the furnace god Molech. In an hour-long ritual begun at midnight, you dedicate a living being to Molech by branding the deity’s symbol onto the victim’s forehead. If the ritual is completed and the victim fails to make a successful Wisdom saving throw (or the victim chooses not to make one), the being is transformed into an avatar of Molech under your control.</p>
			<p class="indent">The avatar is 8 feet tall and appears to be made of black iron wreathed in lames. Its eyes, mouth, and a portion of its torso are cut away to show the churning ire inside that crackles with wailing voices. The avatar has all the statistics and abilities of an earth elemental, with the following diferences:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Alignment is Neutral Evil;</li>
				<li>Speed is 50 feet and it cannot burrow or use earth glide;</li>
				<li>it gains the ire form ability of a ire elemental, but it cannot squeeze through small spaces;</li>
				<li>its Slam does an additional 1d10 ire damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This transformation lasts for 24 hours. At the end of that time, the subject returns to its normal state and takes 77 (14d10) ire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You wind your music box and call forth a piece of another plane of existence with which you are familiar, either through personal experience or intense study. The magic creates a bubble of space with a 30-foot radius within range of you and at a spot you designate. The portion of your plane that’s inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is atuned with.</p>
			<p class="indent">There is a 10% chance that the portion of the plane you summon arrives with native creatures on it. Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut of at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don’t it inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shit planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shit occurs.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (ire spreads, water lows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and efects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes. The two displaced bubbles shit back to their original places automatically ater 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">Note that the amount of preparation involved (acquiring and atuning the music box) precludes this spell from being cast on the spur of the moment. Because of its unpredictable and potentially wideranging efect, it’s also advisable to discuss your interest in this spell with your GM before adding it to your character’s repertoire.</p>

			<p>You cause a targeted piece of clockwork to speed up past the point of control for the duration of the spell. The targeted clockwork can’t cast spells with verbal components or even communicate efectively (all its uterances sound like grinding gears). At the start of each of its turns, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the clockwork moves at three times its normal speed in a random direction and then its turn ends; it can’t perform any other actions. If the saving throw succeeds, then until the end of its turn, the clockwork’s speed is doubled and it gains an additional action, which must be Atack (one weapon atack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object. When the spell ends, the clockwork takes 2d8 force damage.</p>
