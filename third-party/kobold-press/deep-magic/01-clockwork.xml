			<p><strong>The Universe is a Machine. Your Hand is On The Lever.</strong></p>
			<p>You’ve been trained to sense the movements of vast, invisible gears, and to wield the tools of making and dismantling. Your garments are smudged with oil and singed with fire; goggles protect your eyes from flying sparks and the sweat that pours from your brow as you labor in your workshop.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Clockwork brings the secrets of clockwork magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Clockwork domain for clerics, featuring Improved mending, Channel Magic, and Clockwork Apotheosis</li>
				<li>The Great Machine pact for warlocks, with three new invocations: cloud of cogs, heat of the furnace, and voice of the machine</li>
				<li>A Clockwork Mage school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Clockwork Savant, Clockworker’s Charm, Metal Shape, Golem Form, and Clockwork Mastery</li>
				<li>45 new and updated spells, including chains of the goddess, gear barrage, hellforging, robe of shards, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The magic of the gears is yours to control! Will you use it to uphold order, progress, and industry? Or grind your enemies under the ceaseless cogs of might…?</p>
