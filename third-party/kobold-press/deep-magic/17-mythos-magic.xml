			<p><strong>Unnameable Secrets of the Great Old Ones!</strong></p>
			<p>Some warlocks, wizards, and clerics deal with creatures far worse than demons and devils—malevolent alien beings from beyond space and time. These entities’ minds are immeasurably superior to our own. Their sinister, loathsome agendas challenge not only our sanity, but our very existence. And yet, and yet…the revelations they offer…</p>
			<p>The 20 scrawled and creeping pages of Deep Magic: Mythos Magic bring the magic of classic cosmic horror tales into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Grimoires of the Cthulhu Mythos, including the Necronomicon</li>
				<li>Rules for tracking the mental and physical corruption that result from learning Mythos spells</li>
				<li>20 new spells, including black goat’s blessing, emanation of Yoth, sleep of the deep, yellow sign, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As a Mythos caster you have the power to summon sanity-shattering servitors, warp reality, and even make the stars right again through force of will. The cost is too terrible to contemplate, but you will follow this path wherever it takes you, and face whatever doom awaits you at the end.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This dubious old book, which is bound in heavy leather with iron hasps, details the forbidden secrets and monstrous blasphemy of a multitude of nightmare cults that worship nameless and ghastly entities. It reads like the conversation of a maniac, filled with fluctuating moments of vagueness and clarity and illustrated with unsettling hieroglyphs.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tome contains all mythos magic spells in this supplement, plus any additional spells of the GM’s design or choosing.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can reference Nameless Cults whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about any aspect of evil or the occult, such as lore about Great Old Ones, mythos creatures, or the cults that worship them. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>

	<element name="Necronomicon" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Mythos Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMMM_MAGIC_ITEM_NECRONOMICON">
		<description>
			<p>This monstrous tome bound in humanoid skin seethes with dread. A grotesque and ghoulish face is stretched across its loathsome cover.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Necronomicon is replete with fantastic legends of elder magic and abhorred secrets from beyond the Void. Its author, the mad poet-philosopher Alhazred, is said to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of horror-stricken witnesses. Throughout unknown centuries, The Necronomicon was rigidly suppressed by civil authorities and by all branches of organised ecclesiasticism. Reading this dreaded tome always leads to terrible consequences.</p>
			<p class="indent">Among its hideous contents, the Necronomicon details abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions both known and unknown. It describes the presence of forbidden cults among human beings who serve elder, primordial races and who worship unseen entities with alien‑tongued names such as Yog-Sothoth and Cthulhu.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite centuries of repression, an unknown handful of copies of this horrible artifact still exist. Each and every one is a closely guarded secret of its owner, and not all their owners are human or even humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent">To reap the “benefits” of The Necronomicon, a creature must become attuned to it and then spend another 19 hours reading and studying its blasphemous text. The creature can then add to and copy the book’s contents, provided any additions advance Chaos or Evil and expand the lore already contained within. (Because of this, no two copies of The Necronomicon are identical, and no one knows precisely what’s been added to or excised from Alhazred’s original text.)</p>
			<p class="indent">When a non-Evil creature attunes to The Necronomicon, that creature must make a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw or its alignment changes to Neutral Evil.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unseen forces of Evil will pursue you as long as you possess The Necronomicon, hoping to steal it away for themselves or for a more powerful master. Once every three days while you are attuned to the book, you have a 19% chance to encounter or be attacked by a mythos entity or occult adversary of the GM’s choosing. If you die while attuned to the book, a Great Old One claims your soul, and you can’t be restored to life by any means while it bends your soul to its own purposes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Necronomicon has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>2 major detrimental properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Adjusted Ability Scores.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24, and your Wisdom score decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Abstract Formulae.</em></strong> The Necronomicon contains a multitude of spells of mind-shattering evil, including all mythos spells contained in this supplement, all Void magic spells from Deep Magic 3: Void Magic or the Midgard Heroes Handbook, all standard necromancy spells, and any additional spells of the GM’s design or choosing.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Eldritch Magic.</em></strong> Once you’ve read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a warlock or wizard spell counts as a spell slot one level higher when determining the spell’s effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Eldritch Lore.</em></strong> You can reference The Necronomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about any aspect of evil or secrets of the multidimensional universe, such as lore about Great Old Ones or the properties of disquieting technology. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Eldritch Guise.</em></strong> While you carry The Necronomicon and are attuned to it, you can speak, read, and write Void Speech, and you can cast semblance of dread* as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Voidmarked.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire mental and physical disfigurements as hideous signs of your blasphemous devotion to the Great Old Ones. You gain one flesh warp and one indefinite madness. The voidmark grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with aberrations and on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-aberrations.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Thought Control.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on a target creature within range (save DC 18). You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The Necronomicon allows pages to be torn from it, but any eldritch lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author or translator adds pages to the tome. It is rumored that The Necronomicon can’t be destroyed as long as a spawn of Great Old One Azathoth exists in the multiverse. However, casting the book into the fire of a dying star scorches all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 6d6 + 6 years.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spell transforms a Small, Medium, or Large creature that you can see within range into a servant of Yig (Creature Codex). An unwilling creature can attempt a Wisdom saving throw, negating the effect with a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The target’s stats, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a servant of Yig. The transformed creature becomes Neutral Evil, and it’s both friendly to you and reverent toward the Father of Serpents. Only its equipment is unchanged. The transformed creature can opt to make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. If it succeeds, the creature’s alignment and personality return to normal for the duration and it regains its former attitude toward you and toward Yig.</p>
			<p class="indent">When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.</p>

			<p>You call forth a Medium-sized ectoplasmic manifestation that appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range that you can see. The manifestation lasts for the spell’s duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the manifestation takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can move the manifestation up to 30 feet. It can move through one creature’s space but can’t remain in the same space as that creature. If the ectoplasm enters a creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 psychic damage, or half damage with a successful Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you move the manifestation, it can flow through a gap as small as 1 square inch, over barriers up to 5 feet tall, and across pits up to 10 feet wide. The manifestation sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also leaves a thin film of ectoplasmic residue on everything it touches or moves through. This residue doesn’t illuminate the surroundings but does glow dimly enough to show the manifestation’s path. The residue dissipates one round later.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>You contact a Great Old One and ask one question that can be answered with a one-sentence reply no more than twenty words long. You must ask your question before the spell ends. There is a 25 percent chance the answer contains a falsehood or is misleading in some way (the GM determines this secretly).</p>
			<p class="indent">Great Old Ones have vast knowledge but they aren’t omniscient, so if your question pertains to information beyond the Old One’s knowledge, the answer might be vacuous, gibberish, or an angry “I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="indent">This contact also reveals the presence of all aberrations within 300 feet of you. There is a 1-in-6 chance that each aberration you become aware of also becomes aware of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you cast eldritch communion two or more times before taking a long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you receive no answer and become afflicted with shortterm madness.</p>

It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue a command to it, the ghost defends itself from hostile creatures but doesn’t move or take other actions.</p>

			<p>Your touch inflicts a nauseating, alien rot. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with the supernatural disease green decay (see below), and creatures within 15 feet of the target who can see it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">You lose Concentration on this spell if you can’t see the target at the end of your turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Green Decay.</em></strong> The creature’s flesh is slowly consumed by a virulent extraterrestrial fungus. While the disease persists, the creature has disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom checks and on Wisdom saving throws, and it is vulnerable to acid, fire, and necrotic damage. The affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If the creature succeeds at three of these saving throws before it fails at three of them, the disease ends immediately (but damage and maximum hit point reductions remain in effect). If the creature fails at three of these saving throws before succeeding at three of them, the disease lasts for the duration of the spell with no further saving throws against it needed or allowed.</p>

			<p>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you project your mind into the body of the target. You use the target's statistics but don’t gain access to its knowledge, class features, or proficiencies, retaining your own instead. Meanwhile, the target’s mind is shunted into your body, where it uses your statistics but likewise retains its own knowledge, class features, and proficiencies.</p>

When the mind exchange ends, both switched minds return to their original bodies. The target of the spell is immune to mind exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the exchange ends.</p>

			<p>This spell impregnates a living creature with a rapidly‑gestating hydra that consumes the target from within before emerging to wreak havoc on the world. Make a ranged spell attack against a living creature within range that you can see. On a hit, you implant a five-headed embryonic growth into the creature. Roll 1d3 + 1 to determine how many rounds the embryo takes to mature.</p>
			<p class="indent">During those rounds when the embryo is gestating, the affected creature takes 12 (5d4) slashing damage at the start of its turn, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the gestation period has elapsed, a tiny hydra erupts from the target’s abdomen at the start of your turn. The hydra appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and immediately grows into a full-size, Huge aberration. Nearby creatures are pushed away to clear a Huge space as the hydra grows. This is a standard hydra but with the Innate Spellcasting ability to cast bane as an action (spell save DC 11) requiring no spell components. Roll initiative for the hydra, which takes its own turn. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't give it a command or it can’t follow your command for some reason, the hydra attacks the nearest living creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of each of the hydra’s turns, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the hydra remains under your control and friendly to you and your companions. On a failed save, your control ends, the hydra becomes hostile to all creatures, and it attacks the nearest creature to the best of its ability.</p>
			<p class="indent">The hydra disappears at the end of the spell’s duration or its existence can be cut short with a wish spell or comparable magic, but nothing less. The embryo can be destroyed before reaching maturity with a dispel magic spell under the normal rules for dispelling high-level magic.</p>

			<p>You adopt a chaotic and tenebrous visage of the faceless god Nyarlathotep. For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you and able to see you can't willingly move closer to you unless it makes a successful Wisdom saving throw as it tries to approach.

		<description>
			<p>You invoke the twilight citadels of Koth to create a field of magical energy in the shape of a 60-footradius, 60-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point you can touch. The only visible evidence of this field is an inky black rune that appears at the spot touched and on every doorway, window, or other portal inside the cylindrical area.</p>
			<p class="indent">Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: aberrations, beasts, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. The sign affects creatures of the chosen type (including you, if applicable) in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Those creatures can't willingly enter the cylinder’s area by nonmagical means; the cylinder acts as an invisible, impenetrable wall of force. If an affected creature tries to enter the cylinder’s area via teleportation, a dimensional shortcut, or other magical means, it must make a successful Charisma saving throw or the attempt fails.</li>
				<li>Affected creatures are deafened to all sounds that originate from inside the cylinder.</li>
				<li>Affected creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets inside the cylinder.</li>
				<li>Affected creatures can’t charm, frighten, or possess creatures inside the cylinder.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Creatures that aren’t affected by the field and who take a short rest inside it regain twice the usual number of hit points for each Hit Die spent at the end of the rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast this spell, you can choose to reverse its magic; this will prevent affected creatures from leaving the area instead of from entering it, deafen them to sounds from outside the cylinder, etc. In this case, the field provides no benefit for taking a short rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the radius increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 7th.</p>

			<p class="indent">The strangler is invisible to all creatures except you, and it can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it without speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the strangler starts whispering your name. This whispering is always audible to you, regardless of other sounds in the area, as long as you’re conscious. The strangler sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>
			<p class="indent">If one or more creatures hostile to you are within 5 feet of the strangler at the start of your turn, the strangler attacks one of them with a tentacle. It makes one melee weapon attack; its attack modifier = your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller creature is grappled (escape DC = your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the strangler can’t attack another target. If this attack is a critical hit, the creature also is suffocating and can’t speak until the grapple ends.</p>
