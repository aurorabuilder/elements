			<p><strong>Deep Magic of the Shifting Sands!</strong></p>
			<p>For countless ages, the deserts have held secrets that fascinate, delight, and terrify. Ancient knowledge can be found here by those who know how and where to look. But beware, seeker—for this knowledge is difficult to learn, and dangerous to the unschooled…</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Hieroglyph Magic brings the secrets of hieroglyph magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New Script Carver and Script Sage feats</li>
				<li>21 hieroglyphs whose powers are unlocked by level, and by gaining greater mastery over hieroglyph magic</li>
				<li>18 new hieroglyph spells, including bless the dead, conjure scarab swarm, curse of dust, and form of the gods</li>
				<li>New magic items: Coffer of Memory, Eye of Tetsu, and Nurian Stone</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Though the sky darkens and the jackals howl, your tread is resolute, O sage—for you have mastered the weret hekau, the words of truth. Let those who dwell in ignorance tremble at your approach!</p>
