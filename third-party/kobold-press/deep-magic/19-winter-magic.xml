			<p><strong>Winter Has Come!</strong></p>
			<p>The seasons have power, and that of winter is respected by all living beings—indeed, most of their lives the rest of the year are devoted to preparing to meet it. Winter is blinding snow, and ice driven by howling winds; it is branches stripped bare and hung with icicles, landscapes buried in drifts of white. You have learned to command its power, and unleash on your foes. The 20 pages of Deep Magic: Winter Magicbring the secrets of winter magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new Blizzard’s Heart primal path for barbarians</li>
				<li>The Frozen One, a warlock patron who is the embodiment of winter</li>
				<li>Fimbulwinter’s Advent, a new rune ritual</li>
				<li>20 new spells, including clash of glaciers, ice fortress, steal warmth, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those who oppose you would do well to plan long and carefully. Like winter, you are a force to be reckoned with: a combination of elemental power, dangerous beauty, and the relentless nature of the storm.</p>

			<p>Only the hardiest of folk can survive the near constant wintry weather that besets the Northlands. Among them, barbarians following the Path of the Blizzard’s Heart dance to the wind and swirling snow in mighty winter storms. When rage takes them, they whirl in a similar fashion to these storms. Even when they are calm, they barely conceal the danger beneath their surface, much like winter seems tranquil after a devastating snowstorm.</p>

			<p>Nearly every part of the world must deal with a change in temperature and the coming of winter. Nowhere is this more evident than in the extreme north and extreme south, where winter is a pervasive part of life. As civilization expands into inhospitable terrain and environments, its reliance increases on divine providence to ensure survivability.</p>
			<p class="indent">Good-aligned clerics appeal to winter deities such as Boreas to spare their people the worst of bitter cold, storms that last for days, and other calamities caused by weather. They couch the onset of winter as necessary for strengthening their people and as a respite from toil, pointing to the peacefulness of the frozen, snow-draped landscape. Evil clerics embrace the storms and brutal conditions and even enhance them to advance their deities’ agendas and to spread fear through their enemies.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You choose a phrase that freezes the blood of a target creature. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw when chilling words is cast. On a successful saving throw, the spell has no effect. On a failed saving throw, the target is susceptible to the phrase for the duration of the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When a susceptible target hears the phrase, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and become restrained for 1 round. Whether the Constitution saving throw succeeds or fails, the target can’t be affected by the phrase for 1 minute afterward. Once a creature utters the phrase to the target, that creature can’t affect the target with the phrase for the spell’s duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">You also have the option to make a final utterance of the phrase (even if you’ve used the phrase on this target previously). On hearing the final utterance, the target takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained for 1 minute; or, with a successful Constitution saving throw, it takes half damage and is restrained for 1 round. After this final utterance, the spell ends.</p>

			<p>A gleaming fortress of ice springs from a square area of ground that you can see within range. It is a 10-foot cube (including floor and roof). The fortress can’t overlap any other structures, but any creatures in its space are harmlessly lifted up as the ice rises into position. The walls are made of ice (AC 13), have 120 hit points each, and are immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50 percent chance to cause the roof to collapse. A damaged wall can be repaired by casting a spell that deals cold damage on it, on a point-for-point basis.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes an ice door with an arcane lock. You designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can enter the fortification. The door has AC 18 and 60 hit points, or it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15 if the arcane lock is dispelled).</p>
			<p class="indent">The fortress catches and reflects light so that creatures outside the fortress who rely on sight have disadvantage on Perception checks and attack rolls made against those within the fortress, if it’s in an area of bright sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for every slot level above 5th. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spell invokes the deepest part of night on the winter solstice. You target a 40-foot-radius, 60-foothigh cylinder centered on a point within range, which is plunged into darkness and unbearable cold. All creatures in the area when you cast the spell and at the beginning of your turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold are also immune to the exhaustion effect, as are creatures wearing cold weather gear or otherwise adapted to cold.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can move the center of the effect 20 feet.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Upon casting wintry glide, you can travel via ice or snow without crossing the intervening space. If you are adjacent to a mass of ice or snow, you can enter it by expending 5 feet of movement. You can immediately exit from that mass of ice or snow at any point within 500 feet that’s part of the contiguous mass of ice or snow, by expending another 5 feet of movement. When you enter the ice or snow, you instantly know the extent of the material within 500 feet. You must have at least 10 feet of movement available when you cast the spell or it fails.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the mass of ice or snow is somehow destroyed while you are transiting it, you must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage and falling prone at the midpoint of a line between your entrance point and your intended exit point.</p>
