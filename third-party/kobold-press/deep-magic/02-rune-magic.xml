			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rune Bonus.</em></strong> You get a +1 bonus on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to identify the type, powers, or weaknesses of aberrations, celestials, fey, and fiends. Once per day, the ansuz rune can be sketched on an object to ward of giants and fey hostile to the Aesir. The rune must be presented boldly toward such creatures, each of which makes a Charisma saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw must stay at least 5 feet away from the rune and cannot touch or make melee atacks against the creature presenting it, as long as the symbol is boldly and aggressively presented (which requires an action each round). Sketching the rune takes 1 action, and the marked object remains effective for 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rune Power (7th-level).</em></strong> Sketching ansuz on the floor or a wall allows all worshipers of the Aesir within 10 feet of it to add 1d4 to each of their atack rolls, similar to a bless spell. Sketching the rune takes 2 actions, and it remains effective while you concentrate, for up to 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rune Mastery Power (11th-level).</em></strong> When traced on the forehead of a willing creature, ansuz sends the creature into a trance during which it receives a message from the gods, identical in effect to a divination spell. A creature can experience only one such trance per week. Tracing the rune takes 10 minutes, and the trance lasts 1 round.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="underline"><em>Necromancy ritual</em></p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 90 minutes</li>
				<li><strong>Range:</strong> within 20 feet of an appropriate burial place</li>
				<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (wine or mead poured onto the ground, gifts for the vaettir worth 500 gp, 2d6 hit points of the caster’s blood, and the wound can’t be healed until an agreement is reached with the vaettir)</li>
				<li><strong>Duration:</strong> up to 28 days</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>“Come forth from your mound, sleeping hero. Come forth for the honors I would bestow and the honor of those who dwell in your shadow. Come forth by the blood I spill and the gold I give you. Come forth and aid the children of your land.”</p>
			<p class="indent">You call for aid from a vaettir—one of the dead and undead ancestors or former occupants of the land. You must be related to the creature, must have lived nearby for at least a year, or must have a relative of the creature present at the ritual of their own free will. Entreaties can raise the vaettir from their barrows to protect, bestow blessings, or remove curses.</p>
			<p class="indent">The vaettir, however, are greedy and demanding allies. hey’re also difficult to send away once roused, requiring a successful Charisma (Persuasion) contest at the least, bribery or even a sacrifice at the most; the speciic price is determined by the GM.</p>
			<p class="indent">The ritual summons an undead creature from beneath the earth. Typically, a vaettir (Tome of Beasts) is summoned, but sometimes other undead answer the call, depending on the nature of the ancestor interred. You can ask the creature to perform one task, such as defending you against atack, bestowing or removing a curse, retrieving a stolen object, avenging an insult, providing information, or a similar favor. The undead will keep at the task until it’s completed or until 28 days have elapsed. The task must be within the undead’s power to accomplish or it simply ignores the request and returns to its repose. For example, a vaettir can’t journey to the elemental planes to retrieve something.</p>
			<p class="indent">Persuading the vaettir to undertake the task requires explaining why you need it done and how it also benefits the vaettir to help—blood relations are strong motivators here—followed by a successful Charisma (Persuasion) contest opposed by the vaettir’s Charisma (or a Bluf contest if the caster lies). Vaettir usually awake with an indiferent atitude; disagreeable, but not outright hostile. If the vaettir is not persuaded to help or is ofended, it’s likely to atack. It may cast bestow curse or geas on you, or rise from its mound to demand tribute, or physically atack you and any associates nearby. At no time during this process is the vaettir under your control. The ritual simply gets it to listen to you, but it makes its own decisions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature typically returns to its barrow or grave when the task is done and it’s collected its payment, tribute, or praise. If anything has been stolen during its absence, it’s certain to seek recompense or revenge against the person who called it out.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="underline"><em>Necromancy ritual</em></p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 9 hours per night for 9 consecutive nights</li>
				<li><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</li>
				<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (tupilak construct)</li>
				<li><strong>Duration:</strong> until destroyed, or it destroys its creator</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>his infamous ritual was learned from the enigmatic skraeling of the farthest reaches of the Northlands. It creates a tupilak, a construct that tracks and kills a hated enemy, usually a rival.</p>
			<p class="indent">First, a body must be constructed for the tupilak from the body parts of recently-dead animals and children. The body is wrapped in seaweed or vines and then encased in an outer shell made from bone treated with icy unguents and sealing salves worth 3,000 gp. The body can’t be animated until a tupilak idol (with a material cost of 2,500 gp) is inserted, to serve as its heart. The verbal component is an ancient, hours-long song of revenge, sung over the construct’s body during each night’s ritual. This construction process consumes nine consecutive nights with a 9-hour ritual each night.</p>
			<p class="indent">The inal ritual captures a hungry spirit of Ginnungagap to animate the construct. hese spirits are vengeful and mercenary; many intended victims of tupilaks have saved their own lives by iguring out how to turn a resentful, murderous construct against its creator.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="underline"><em>Necromancy ritual</em></p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 90 minutes</li>
				<li><strong>Range:</strong> 25 feet</li>
				<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (animal of the kind you wish to create, which is killed during the ritual, plus powdered silver worth at least 500 gp)</li>
				<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>You trace runes in a circle around a sacriicial animal and a bound target, chanting courtesies and praise to the old ways and the wildness hidden in all, as a lunar eclipse signals that the witching hour approaches.</p>
			<p class="indent">By creating a circle of arcane and wild natural glyphs from powdered silver, sacriicing an animal, and sprinkling its blood onto a target while imploring the spirits of the wild and old ways to heed your call, you transform a living creature into a lycanthrope. The type of lycanthrope matches the animal that was sacrificed (bear, wolf, boar, etc.). An unwilling target must be bound and helpless, and it still makes a Charisma saving throw; the DC equals 8 + your Charisma modiier + your proficiency bonus. If the saving throw succeeds, the intended target resists the transformation and the curse descends on you instead!</p>
			<p class="indent">The affected target transforms into its lycanthropic form 10 minutes after the ritual is completed.</p>
			<p class="indent">An unwilling target alicted with lycanthropy through this ritual is driven to hunt and slay the person who conducted the ritual. hey can control their bloodlust when in human form, but when the beast takes control, they seek the one who cursed them. Because their rational mind and memories are suppressed in animal form, the hunt isn’t organized or eicient, but sometimes they stumble onto a scent that puts them on the right trail. In their murderous rage, they’ll kill anyone related to the target of their hate. A lycanthrope created by the ritual rebounding on its caster tends to be the most savage, unreasoning of all; they’re known for slaughtering their own families, friends, and neighbors.</p>

			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 4 hours</li>
				<li><strong>Range:</strong> Self</li>
				<li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a whip made from netles; blood, hair, or other sympathetic object from the target, smeared or hung around your neck)</li>
				<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour per check</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>How much are you willing to sufer to inlict pain on your enemy? Scourge your own flesh with a whip of netles and briars, and as long as you can stand the logging, the target sufers three times the pain you do. The target’s flesh first itches uncontrollably, then turns raw and blistered, then bleeds freely. The slightest movement or weight on his back is agony.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target of the ritual must be within 10 miles of the caster.</p>
			<p class="indent">To represent the first hour of the ritual, the caster takes 1d6 psychic damage and the target and caster conduct a Constitution contest. The loser of the contest gains one level of exhaustion.</p>
			<p class="indent">The caster can continue the ritual for as long as he or she is willing to take the punishment. In practical terms, a caster is unlikely to continue the ritual after losing thef irst contest because exhaustion oten puts him or her at a disadvantage on subsequent Constitution checks.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only living creatures that feel pain and injury can cast this ritual, which lasts as long as you continue scourging yourself. For each additional hour spent scourging, the caster takes another 1d6 psychic damage and the target and caster conduct another Constitution contest, with the loser gaining one level of exhaustion. The caster can recover from exhaustion normally through rest, but the target’s exhaustion can be removed only by limited wish, remove curse, wish, or comparable magic. If the caster’s pain, damage, or exhaustion is treated in any way during the ritual, the ritual ends immediately. When the ritual ends, the caster takes another 1d6 psychic damage and gains a inal level of exhaustion.</p>

				<li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 5 hours</li>
				<li><strong>Range:</strong> 35 feet</li>
				<li><strong>Components:</strong> S, V (a promise of safe passage and an oath to do no unlawful violence; oaths need not be sincere but must be explicit)</li>
				<li><strong>Duration:</strong> up to 9 days</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>You call upon Tyr to ward of treachery and violence at a meeting. At least nine men and/or women must swear the oath of amity, and they must include representatives of each faction (family, clan, nation, felag, etc.) being covered by the ritual. The duration and area of effect (which can be as small as a single room or as large as 12 square miles—a radius of 2 miles around the ritual site) are set during the casting. Performing the ritual adds one level of exhaustion to the caster, and the blood oferings demanded by Tyr and the ancestors cause 1d6 slashing damage to each participant in the ritual.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once it takes efect, the ritual punishes anyone from an affected faction who spills blood in the area. Legal executions, religious sacrifices, and sanctioned duels of honor are exempt. The ritual’s protection covers only those factions that were invoked and swore the oath of peace in the casting, either as victims or as perpetrators. Anyone who kills or harms another is cursed (as the bestow curse spell), as is every intelligent creature complicit in the misdeed. The curse manifests as bloody hands (no amount of washing can clean away the blood) and disadvantage on Charisma checks. The curse can be lited by limited wish, wish, remove curse, or comparable magic, but the curse must be lited individually from each affected person.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You seal an agreement between two or more willing creatures with an oath in the name of Tyr, using ritual blessings and toasts of the symbel, during which both the oath and the consequences are clearly set out. If any of the sworn break this solemn vow, they are struck by a curse. The caster can choose either an effect appropriate for bestow curse or another penalty, subject to the GM’s approval. Binding oath can’t be dismissed by dispel magic, but it can be removed with dispel evil and good, remove curse, or wish. Remove curse functions only if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or higher than the spell slot used to cast binding oath.</p>
			<p class="indent">Then the oath is broken or the effect removed from one of the participants, all targets are immediately aware that this has occurred, but no other details. Depending on the nature of the oath, this may or may not invalidate the oath for the other targets. If so, the spell ends for all other affected creatures, but curse effects already bestowed remain until dispelled.</p>

			<p>If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, it and its equipment are frozen solid, becoming a physically inert statue of ice. The creature is effectively paralyzed, but mental activity does not cease and signs of life are detectable; the creature still breathes and its heart continues to beat, though both happen so slowly as to be almost imperceptible. If the ice statue is broken or damaged while frozen, the creature will have matching damage or injury when returned to its original state.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dispel magic can’t end this spell, but it can allow the target to speak (but not move or cast spells) for 1 round per the spell slot used. Greater restoration or more potent magic is needed to free a creature from the ice.</p>
			<p class="indent">Boreas and certain of his followers can use scrying to spy through the target’s senses, and the target receives no saving throw against this efect. Those touching a frozen target can request an audience with Boreas, and if they make a successful DC 15 Charisma check, he’ll respond to their request through the ice.</p>

			<p>Cursed gift imbues an object with a curse or other unwanted, harmful magical effect that the caster or another creature in physical contact with the caster is currently suffering from. If this item is given to someone who freely accepts it during the duration of the spell, then the curse temporarily transfers to them. A successful Charisma saving throw negates the transfer. If the saving throw fails, the original target of the curse no longer sufers from the aliction, which transfers to the recipient of the item for the duration of the spell. Returning, destroying, or giving away the item a second time has no efect. Remove curse and comparable magic can relieve the person who received the item, but the curse still returns to the original victim when the spell expires.</p>

		<supports>Cleric,Warlock,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell is infamous for its use among feuding wizards and witches, because it lets the caster steal one or more spell slots from the target. Grasp of the tupilak remains effective for 1 hour or until it’s triggered. When you make a successful melee atack, besides doing normal melee damage, the target takes an additional 2d4 necrotic damage and one or more of the defender’s spell slots are transferred to you, for you to use as your own. Roll 1d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest level possible are transferred before lowerlevel slots. For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you receive a 3rd-level slot plus a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available. You can steal either arcane or divine spell slots, at your preference.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crucially, however, spell slots can be stolen only from casters who prepare spells in advance. If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all its 1st and 2nd-level spell slots—then grasp of the tupilak has no efect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is higher than you’re able to use, treat it as your highest-level slot.</p>
			<p class="indent">A spellcaster who’s been affected by grasp of the tupilak can’t recover stolen spell slots until the stolen slot is used, you take a long rest, or they receive remove curse, greater restoration, or comparable magic. Unused stolen spell slots disappear from your inventory when you take a long rest or when the creature you stole them from receives restorative magic.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You infuse the metal of a melee weapon with the fearsome aura of a mighty hero. The weapon’s wielder has advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks made while aggressively brandishing the weapon. In addition, an opponent that currently has 30 or fewer hit points and is struck by the weapon must make a Charisma saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the creature has more than 30 hit points but fewer than the weapon’s wielder currently has, it becomes frightened instead; a frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect on the same weapon for 24 hours.</p>

			<p>Loki’s gift makes even the most barefaced lie seem strangely plausible: you gain advantage to Charisma (Deception) checks for whatever you’re currently saying. If your Deception check fails, the creature knows that you tried to manipulate it with magic. If you lie to a creature that has a friendly atitude toward you and it fails a Charisma saving throw, you can also coax him or her to reveal a potentially embarrassing secret. The secret can involve wrongdoing (adultery, cheating at tal, a secret fear, etc.) but not something life-threatening or dishonorable enough to earn the subject repute as a nithling. The verbal component of this spell is the lie you are telling.</p>

			<p>You mark the target’s body with a unique rune that represents their fate. The rune protects against death from either a speciic damage type (slashing, poison, fire, radiant, etc.) or a category of creature (giant, beast, elemental, monstrosity, etc.) that must be named when the spell is cast. For the next 24 hours, the target has advantage on saving throws involving that type of damage or creature, including death saving throws if the atack that dropped the target to 0 hit points is covered by this spell. A character can be under the effect of only a single not this day! rune at one time; a second casting on the same target cancels the preexisting protection.</p>

For the duration of the spell, whenever the atacker takes damage while holding the weapon, the target takes the same amount and type of damage; a successful Charisma saving throw by the target halves the damage it takes, with each atack calling for a new saving throw. The atacker can even turn the weapon against himself or herself and cause identical damage to the target. Selfinlicted wounds hit automatically, but damage is still rolled randomly. Once the connection is established, it lasts for the duration of the spell regardless of range, so long as all three elements remain on the same plane. The spell ends immediately if the atacker receives any healing.</p>

	<element name="Nithing Pole" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Rune Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_MAGIC_ITEM_NITHING_POLE">
		<description>
			<p>A nithing pole is crated to exact retribution for an act of cowardice or dishonor. It’s a sturdy wooden stave, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the stave’s curse. The carved shat is draped in horsehide, topped with a horse’s skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by; typically the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky clet in a remote spot where the intended victim won’t see it until it’s too late.</p>
			<p class="indent">A pole is created to punish a speciic person for a speciic crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn’t precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with range 333 feet instead of touch) on the target.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DC for the target’s Wisdom saving throw is 15; if the target’s saving throw succeeds, the pole recasts the spell every round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the nithing pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole’s creator who tries to destroy or knock down a nithing pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once.</p>
			<p class="indent">The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target; an untriggered and forgoten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries. The curse lasts 8 hours and doesn’t require concentration.</p>

	<element name="Snow Blindness" type="Information" source="Deep Magic: Rune Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_INFORMATION_SNOW_BLINDNESS">
		<description>
			<p>Northerners believe that snow blindness is caused by light glitering on snow or ice, and sometimes by malevolent spirits. The real cause is intense ultraviolet rays burning the eye.</p>
			<p class="indent">Snow blindness becomes a danger after 4 hours of exposure to a brightly sunlit snowscape. Starting at the end of the 4th hour of exposure, a character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour; the DC equals 10 + hours exposed beyond 3 (or, for simplicity, 7 + hours of exposure).</p>
			<p class="indent">Travelers have devised effective precautions. Characters can avoid making a check by taking a short rest after 3 hours, or by wearing dark goggles or snow visors (similar to goggles but made from an opaque material such as bone with a narrow, horizontal slit instead of tinted lenses). Monsters native to the environment are immune, as are constructs and undead.</p>
			<p class="indent">Failing the saving throw imposes the first stage of snow blindness: the character has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, weapon and spell ranges (for visually targeted spells) are halved, and all atack rolls are made with a –2 penalty. A second failed saving throw brings on the second stage of snow blindness: severe pain in the eyes, sight range is limited to 15 feet, and disadvantage on atack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Spending two days in a dimly-lit environment reduces snow blindness by one stage. Sight is restored completely by lesser restoration or comparable magic.</p>
