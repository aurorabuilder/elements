			<p><strong>Turn the Tide of Battle!</strong></p>
			<p>Some who follow the path of sword and shield scorn magic as a tool of the weak—but there is a kind of magic that even they respect. It enhances a warrior's ability to anticipate foes' actions, allowing them to react even before an attack takes place. Its practitioners can see subtle cues in the flow of battle that others miss, heed premonitions of victory or woe, and hone their intuition to a keenness that can save their comrades’ lives.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Combat Divination brings the secrets of combat divination into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New Farseer sorcerous origin, Sybil warlock patron, and Prescient Knight martial tradition.</li>
				<li>Two new feats: Arcane Prescience and Clairvoyant Warrior.</li>
				<li>19 new spells, including insightful maneuver, litany of sure hands, sidestep arrow, and soothsayer’s shield.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Smoke chokes the air, and the clash of metal and screams of the fallen ring in your ears. But you have no fear, for you are shielded by powerful magic and guided by unerring visions. Today, you shall prevail!</p>

			<p>Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know just when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is accessible within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed less than 10 for any other reason). This doesn’t count as part of your normal movement. After the spell is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you’re not hidden.</p>

			<p>Your foreknowledge allows you to act before others because you knew this was going to happen. When you cast this spell, reroll your Dexterity check for initiative with a +5 bonus. Your initiative equals the higher of the two results. If that number is higher than the current initiative number, take your turn immediately but switch to the higher number next round.</p>

			<p>With a few perfectly timed steps, you maneuver a foe between you and danger. You can cast this spell when a foe targets you with a ranged attack but before the attack roll is made, the spell is cast, etc. At least one other foe must be within 10 feet of you when you cast sidestep arrow. As part of casting the spell, you can move up to 15 feet to place an enemy between you and the attacker, in the direct line of attack. You must be able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to speed 0 for any other reason). This move does not provoke opportunity attacks. After you've moved, the ranged attack is resolved with the intervening foe as the target instead of you.</p>

			<p>You set a series of small events in motion that cause the targeted creature to drop one nonmagical item of your choice that it's currently holding unless it makes a successful Charisma saving throw. This spell can't cause magic items to be dropped.</p>

			<p>Twisting the knife, slapping with the butt of the spear, cutting again as you recover from a lunge, and countless other double-strike maneuvers are skillful ways to get more from your weapon. By casting this spell as a bonus action after making a successful melee weapon attack, you inflict an additional 2d6 damage of the weapon's type to the target. If your attack roll was a natural 19, the attack becomes a critical hit and you also add the weapon's basic damage die or dice (the normal damage boost for a critical hit) to the 2d6 bonus damage, along with any other special result you would normally cause with a critical hit.</p>

			<p>You tweak a strand of a creature’s fate as it makes an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll 1d20 – 10 to produce a number from 10 to –9. Add that number to the creature's roll, increasing or decreasing the result accordingly. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it may not change the outcome at all. The target must use the modified result regardless of whether it’s better or worse than the original.</p>
