			<p><strong>Deep Magic of the Dwarf-Rings!</strong></p>
			<p>Since the dawn of the world, dwarven smiths have fashioned rings of surpassing beauty—but it is not for the sake of beauty alone that these rings are made. There is power in them, which can be unlocked by the wise. Ring magic practitioners channel their magic through these rune-etched metal bands, increasing the devastation wreaked upon their foes; and can even imbue them with spells that someone else can unleash later.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Ring Magic brings the secrets of ring magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New ring magic feats, and a new Ring Warden arcane tradition</li>
				<li>12 new spells, including enchant ring, curse ring, and create ring servant (with monster stats for this new construct), and more!</li>
				<li>New magic items: molten fire forge, oathbound ring, warden’s link, and Karrek’s Bastion</li>
				<li>The history of ring magic, the dwarves who are its masters, and the secrets of their legendary stronghold</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Journey deep within the earth, to places where molten rock flows like rivers, and the sounds of hammers never cease. Here you will find the true power of the rings—learn their ways, and use them wisely and well.</p>

			<p><strong><em>Prerequisite:</em></strong> The ability to cast at least one spell.</p>
			<p>You have learned to create a circular flow of magic between yourself and an allied spellcaster to bolster your spells. You gain the following benefits.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You can spend 2 hours (including during a long rest) creating a mystical bond with another spellcaster. Both of you must spend this time in meditation, and you must remain within 10 feet of each other. Once the bond is formed, you can work together to bolster one another’s magic. When one of you casts a spell that requires concentration, the other can use their reaction to help maintain the spell. If the caster must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on the spell, both of you make the saving throw. If either of you succeeds, concentration is unbroken. If both saving throws fail, you both lose concentration on any spells you are currently maintaining and you both take 2d6 psychic damage from the strain. You can maintain this bond with only one spellcaster at a time. If you create a new bond, the previous bond breaks. Otherwise, it lasts until the end of your next long rest.</li>

Each image is identical, and only vision is affected. Sounds, movement, or physical inspection can give the ruse away.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, that creature sees through the image.</p>

	<element name="Molten Fire Forge" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Ring Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_MAGIC_ITEM_MOLTEN_FIRE_FORGE">
		<description>
			<p>This magical furnace and anvil were patterned off the original forges in the deep halls of the ring wardens. Rarely, a molten fire forge is given as a gift to a warlord who champions the cause of the wardens and proves himself an unwavering ally.</p>
			<p class="indent">A character proficient with blacksmith’s tools who creates a weapon or armor of sufficient quality using the forge finds his creations imbued with magic. The forge allows for the creation of magic weapons and armor without the need to find a formula. The maximum quality of item produced is one rarity less than that of the forge itself; a rare molten fire forge can produce uncommon items, such as a weapon +1, or adamantine armor, for example. The creator must provide the required gold and makes progress toward completion as normal for crafting a magic item. If the creator doesn’t meet the level requirement for the rarity of the item being created, the creator can attempt a Wisdom check with blacksmith’s tools; the DC = 10, plus 5 for every rarity level above uncommon. If the check succeeds, the item is created successfully. On a failure, the enchantment fails and the gold and time are spent creating a nonmagical, but likely high quality, item.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any item created with the molten fire forge requires GM approval. The GM may require special components or materials in addition to the normal gold cost.</p>

	<element name="Oathbound Ring" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Ring Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_MAGIC_ITEM_OATHBOUND_RING">
		<description>
			<p>This adamantine ring is plain on the outside, but dwarven runes demanding honor and fidelity are inscribed on the inside of the band. The few oathbound rings known to exist were given to nondwarf visitors to the halls of the ring wardens, both to ensure the secrets of ring magic and to protect the wardens’ trusted friends.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you attune to this ring, you willingly swear an oath to an individual or an organization, such as the ring wardens. The oath must be specific about a service you will undertake or some action you will refrain from taking.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to the ring, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and you can’t voluntarily violate the terms of your oath. If a spell or other effect would force you to violate the oath, that spell or effect fails immediately. In the case of an oath of secrecy, mind-reading powers or effects return no useful information if they seek out the knowledge you are sworn to keep. When a creature directly attempts to prevent you from fulfilling your oath, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks made against the creature until it no longer opposes you or it dies. If you die while wearing the ring, spells such as speak with dead also automatically fail if the questions asked of your corpse would violate your oath.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you are attuned to the ring, you can’t voluntarily break that attunement, and the ring can’t be removed. The ring is immune to psychic, poison, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, has AC 20 with a damage threshold of 30, and 50 hit points.</p>

	<element name="Warden’s Link" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Ring Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_MAGIC_ITEM_WARDENS_LINK">
		<description>
			<p>This metal ring is 3 inches in diameter and adorned with dwarven runes. These rings were created by ring wardens to aid their allies in battle, and each one has a specific enchantment reserved for armor, a shield, or a weapon. The warden’s link has a rarity one category higher than the enchantment it bears; for example, a warden’s link enchanted to provide the effects of armor of resistance or a weapon +2 is very rare.</p>
			<p class="indent">A warden’s link confers magical effects when attached to a nonmagical suit of armor, shield, or weapon. Attaching the ring requires 1 hour of work with appropriate tools (leatherworker’s tools or blacksmith’s tools, usually) that can be completed during a short rest. A similar process can remove the ring. While the ring is attached to the correct type of item, the item becomes magical and gains the effects carried by the ring. If the enchantment requires attunement, it can be attuned during the same hour it takes to attach the warden’s link by the person doing the work. Someone else must devote a different hour to attuning.</p>
			<p class="indent">Rumors abound regarding warden’s links that confer the effects of legendary or even artifact-power enchantments, but the truth of such stories is no longer known.</p>

	<element name="Karrek’s Bastion" type="Magic Item" source="Deep Magic: Ring Magic" id="ID_KBP_DMRM_MAGIC_ITEM_KARREKS_BASTION">
		<description>
			<p>Karrek was a dwarven warlord in the time when ring wardens were struggling to realize the full potential of their discovery. Without him, the order would have died before it was born. During the nascent ring wardens’ trek into the earth to find their home, they ran afoul of a great evil host in the depths. They fought bitterly for every inch of ground but were doomed to be driven out of the molten fire caverns or destroyed utterly.</p>
			<p class="indent">One of the pilgrims, a clansman of Karrek’s, sent word of their plight to the surface stronghold, and Karrek himself answered. He led a force of dwarf shocktroops into the depths and turned the tide of battle. Grievously wounded during the fighting, the stubborn chief waved off more than first aid, refusing to be bedridden while there was work to be done and his people to protect. His wounds worsened and on his death bed, the ring wardens showed him their thanks by offering him the chance to protect his people for all time; they bound his soul into an adamantine ring, where he maintains his vigil still.</p>
			<p class="indent">Karrek’s Bastion resembles a warden’s link. It’s a magical, sentient, adamantine ring 3 inches in diameter, decorated with gold-inlaid runes. When the ring is attached to a nonmagical weapon, the weapon</p>
			<ul>
				<li>becomes magical with a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls,</li>
				<li>scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and</li>
				<li>does an additional 1d10 fire damage per hit, or 3d10 fire damage to orcs, giants, goblins, and undead.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> Karrek’s Bastion has the following random properties</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
				<li>1 major detrimental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unyielding Spirit.</em></strong> While you carry Karrek’s Bastion on your person, you have resistance to necrotic damage, your hit point maximum can’t be reduced, and you can’t be frightened.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While the ring is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: death ward, heat metal, or stone shape. Once you use the ring to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> Karrek’s Bastion is a sentient, Lawful Good item with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. The item communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Dwarvish.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The item’s purpose is to defend the ring wardens and their allies and to drive back the foes of the dwarves. It is stubborn, brave to a fault, and enjoys humorous wordplay. It urges its wielder to attach it to a maul above all other weapons, but it will grudgingly accept any martial weapon. Trying to attach it to a finesse or ranged weapon is sure to cause a personality conflict.</p>
			<p class="indent">Karrek’s Bastion deeply hates anyone who steals or misuses the secrets of ring magic, and it drives its wielder to harry such individuals to their doom and recover the stolen secrets.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying Karrek’s Bastion.</em></strong> The adamantine ring must be laid on the first of the forges in the halls of the ring wardens, and one ring warden must slay another ring warden with the forge hammer. While the hammer is still soaked with warm blood, it can be used to unmake the ring on the forge.</p>
