			<p><strong>Speak Not the Words. Read Not the Glyphs!</strong></p>
			<p>The speech of the void is oblivion given form. It corrupts and degrades physical reality. The Great Old Ones murmur it to their followers in nightmares, and it is whispered by creatures that dwell in the silent, cold expanses between the stars. Void magic is anathema to existence itself. Only the mad, desperate, or power-hungry seek to wield it—and you are one of them.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Void Magic brings the secrets of these dark conjurations into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Void school of wizard magic, with two new feats: Void Channeler, and Void Scribe</li>
				<li>A Void Speaker arcane tradition, with new abilities including Whispers of the Void, Rebuke from Beyond, and Powerful Echo</li>
				<li>13 new spells, including conjure voidborn, life drain, maddening whispers, word of misfortune, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Who can say what drives you to master the magic of the void, casting spells that threaten to unmake the universe itself? Yet it may be that someday, when all seems lost, you will be the one who has the power to save the world.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Void magic comprises a dangerous school of wizardry that exists alongside, but in the shadows of, the more well-known practices. his magic is anathema to existence itself, making it diicult to master and dangerous even to study. Dabblers rarely produce efects more profound than minor injury, property damage, and psychological scars to themselves and those around them. More serious investigations into void magic can spell disaster. Only alien creatures whose psychology and physiology defy human understanding seem capable of commanding void magic with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths respect and fear the power of void magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">Void magic spells can never be added to a wizard’s spellbook as part of the two spells learned automatically for gaining a level (with the exception of void savants; see below). To learn a void magic spell, a wizard must find an NPC void speaker who’s willing to impart the knowledge or discover the spell writen as a spell scroll, in a captured spellbook, carved on a temple wall, or some other form of recorded lore. Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and hears a void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her spell book, using the same rules as transcribing a spell from a scroll.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite void magic’s strange origins, it still functions similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level. Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and is susceptible to dispelling, countermagic, and antimagic as normal. Void magic spells always have a verbal component and can’t, under any circumstance, be cast without it.</p>

One creature of your choice within 10 feet that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against this magic (DC 8 + your proiciency bonus + your Charisma modiier) or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the efect on itself on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">Other creatures who can hear you sufer minor reactions to the void speech such as spontaneous nosebleeds, headaches, bits of hair falling out, and other unsetling efects. The first time you use this ability, you sufer no adverse efect. If you use it again before completing a short or long rest, you take 1d4 necrotic damage. Each additional time you use it before finishing a rest, the necrotic damage increases by 1d4.</p>

		<supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Given the nature of void magic, it comes as no surprise that a tradition of wizards sprang up from the study of void speech. Void speakers are a standoish and secretive lot, prone to delving into crumbling, monster-prowled ruins and the dark corners of moldering libraries with equal caution; carelessly reading a text that may be sprinkled with void glyphs can be just as deadly as stumbling into a den of trolls. As you focus your study on void speech, you learn to properly invoke the words and glyphs to empower your magic and to tap the vast potential of the void.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some void speakers risk the darkness for the sake of knowledge or defense against that which lies beyond. Others succumb to the madness and corruption that void magic touches and become living conduits for the horror seeking entry into the mortal world.</p>

			<p>You speak a hideous string of void speech that leaves your mouth bloodied, causing a rit into absolute nothingness to tear open. The rit takes the form of a 10-foot-radius sphere, and it forms around a point you can see within range. The area within 40 feet of the sphere’s outer edge becomes diicult terrain as the void tries to draw everything into itself. All creatures that start their turns within 40 feet of the sphere or that enter that area for the first time on their turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 15 feet toward the rit. Creatures that start their turn in contact with the rit or that come into contact with it for the first time on their turn take 8d10 necrotic damage. Creatures inside the rit are blinded and deafened. Unatended objects within 40 feet of the rit are drawn 15 feet toward it at the start of your turn, and take damage as creatures.</p>
			<p class="indent">hile concentrating on the spell, you take 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of your turn.</p>

			<p>With a short phrase of void speech, you gather writhing darkness around your hand. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a target within range. Make a ranged spell atack. If your target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
