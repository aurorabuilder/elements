			<p><strong>Speak Not the Words. Read Not the Glyphs!</strong></p>
			<p>The speech of the void is oblivion given form. It corrupts and degrades physical reality. The Great Old Ones murmur it to their followers in nightmares, and it is whispered by creatures that dwell in the silent, cold expanses between the stars. Void magic is anathema to existence itself. Only the mad, desperate, or power-hungry seek to wield itâ€”and you are one of them.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Void Magic brings the secrets of these dark conjurations into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Void school of wizard magic, with two new feats: Void Channeler, and Void Scribe</li>
				<li>A Void Speaker arcane tradition, with new abilities including Whispers of the Void, Rebuke from Beyond, and Powerful Echo</li>
				<li>13 new spells, including conjure voidborn, life drain, maddening whispers, word of misfortune, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Who can say what drives you to master the magic of the void, casting spells that threaten to unmake the universe itself? Yet it may be that someday, when all seems lost, you will be the one who has the power to save the world.</p>
