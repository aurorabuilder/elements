			<p><strong>Magic Measured in Momentsâ€”and Eternities!</strong></p>
			<p>The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who seek to alter time have the potential to perform incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the great danger of intervening with time, which resists mortal interference. Deep Magic: Time Magicbrings the secrets of temporal magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A divine option for the Time Domain and a Timekeeper arcane tradition for wizards</li>
				<li>A Lost Traveller Background for those who wander in time</li>
				<li>12 new spells, including accelerate, chronal lance, time loop, and wall of time</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Mastery of time itself brings immense power to the caster, but runs enormous risks--not least attracting the attention of archmages and the gods themselves for your meddling! Seize this power boldly, and with respect for the dangers it contains!</p>
