			<p><strong>Powerful Magic of a Bygone Age!</strong></p>
			<p>Legends say that the elves of ancient times could enchant entire cities, change fate, and even reshape worlds, with a power that nearly infringed upon the authority of the gods. These feats are unheard of today, and most non-elves believe elven high magic has died out. But this power still exists, as a closely guarded secret practiced only by the elves and their shadow fey relatives.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Elven High Magic brings the secrets of high elven magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Elven High Magic school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Ritual Focus, Bound Magic, Ritual Mastery, and High Magic</li>
				<li>17 new spells, including black swan storm, song of the forest, afflict line, cosmic alignment, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let the dwarves bluster, and the humans swagger in their ignorance. You will reveal your true power when the moment is right—for with sufficient time, an elf who has mastered the secrets of high magic can accomplish almost anything...</p>

			<p>Elven high magic is very powerful and extremely rare. With high magic and sufficient time, an elven wizard can accomplish just about anything. It is a closely guarded secret, practiced only by the elves and their shadow fey relatives. Non-elves are never taught the ways of this school. That’s both a sign of the elves’ sense of superiority and an unfortunate practicality. High magic can take centuries to master, and humans and other short-lived races simply don’t live long enough to become skilled in this art.</p>

			<p>You invoke the darkest curses upon your victim and his or her descendants. This spell does not require that you have a clear path to your target, only that your target is within range. Your target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be cursed until the magic is dispelled. The victim has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with the ability score that you choose when you cast the spell. In addition, the target’s firstborn offspring is also targeted by the curse. The firstborn is allowed a saving throw of their own if they currently live, or they make one upon their birth if they’re not yet born when the spell is cast. If the target’s firstborn has already died, the curse passes to their next oldest offspring.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the curse becomes hereditary, passing from firstborn to firstborn for the entire length of the family’s lineage until one of them successfully saves against the curse and throws off your dark magic.</p>

Any seeds planted in the area of effect grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature. Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:</p>

			<p>You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you choose within range. Intelligent creatures that enter the area or begin their turn there and fail a Wisdom saving throw engage in revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell expires, preferring to enjoy the festivities. Affected creatures forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking extends regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than serve, guards abandon their posts. The effect ends on creatures that are attacked, that take damage, or that are forced to leave the area. Those whose saving throw succeeds can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that failed the saving throw and is removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if they return to the area.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each slot level above 7th.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, unaffected intelligent creatures must make a new saving throw every time they begin their turn in the area of effect, even if they’ve previously saved against the spell.</p>

This is not a gaze attack, and it cannot be avoided by averting one’s eyes or wearing a blindfold.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, affected creatures without darkvision are charmed instead of blinded.</p>

		<description>
			<p>If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target’s voice, or if the secret is only whispered to you. The shadow speaks Common, unless the target does not speak Common, in which case it speaks in the target’s native language.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target creature does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature’s saving throw had succeeded.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a −2 penalty to Charisma checks with anyone who was present when it was revealed, for the remainder of the day, in addition to any information you obtain or any scandal it provokes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of the −2 penalty, and the target’s status score is reduced by 1 for the remainder of the day (see the <em>Midgard Campaign Setting</em> for status rules). At the end of the day, the target makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If this saving throw fails, rumors of the target’s indiscretion become widespread and the loss of status is permanent.</p>

			<p>You fill a silver cup with your own blood (taking 1d4 piercing damage) while chanting vile curses in the dark. Once the chant is completed, you consume the blood and swear an oath of vengeance against any who harm you.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you are reduced to 0 hit points, your curse is invoked; blood pours from your mouth and steams away into a red mist that transforms into a shadow. The shadow attacks the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points, ignoring all other targets, until it or the target is slain, at which point the shadow dissipates into nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, an additional shadow is conjured for each slot level above 4th.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the spell summons a banshee instead of a shadow. If you also use a higher-level spell slot, additional undead are still shadows.</p>

			<p>You attune your senses to the natural world, so you detect every sound that occurs within 60 feet: wind blowing through branches, falling leaves, grazing deer, trickling streams, and more. You can clearly picture the cause of each sound in your mind. The effect gives you tremorsense with a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound. Creatures that make no noise or that are magically silent cannot be detected through this spell’s effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Song of the forest</em> only functions in natural environments; it fails if cast underground, in a city, or in a building that isolates the caster from nature (GM’s discretion).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the spell’s effect is equivalent to blindsight with a range of 30 feet.</p>

			<p>You make a choking motion while pointing at a target, which must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become unable to communicate verbally. The target’s speech becomes garbled and it has disadvantage on Charisma checks that require speech. The creature can cast a spell with a verbal component only by making a successful Constitution check against your spell save DC. If the Constitution check fails, the creature’s action is used but the spell slot isn’t expended.</p>

			<p>You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (the ground, a wall), but it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates into nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent">The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, (5 x your spellcasting level) hit points, and a damage threshold of 5.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.</p>
