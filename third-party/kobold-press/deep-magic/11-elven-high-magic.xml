			<p><strong>Powerful Magic of a Bygone Age!</strong></p>
			<p>Legends say that the elves of ancient times could enchant entire cities, change fate, and even reshape worlds, with a power that nearly infringed upon the authority of the gods. These feats are unheard of today, and most non-elves believe elven high magic has died out. But this power still exists, as a closely guarded secret practiced only by the elves and their shadow fey relatives.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Elven High Magic brings the secrets of high elven magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An Elven High Magic school of wizard magic, with new abilities including Ritual Focus, Bound Magic, Ritual Mastery, and High Magic</li>
				<li>17 new spells, including black swan storm, song of the forest, afflict line, cosmic alignment, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let the dwarves bluster, and the humans swagger in their ignorance. You will reveal your true power when the moment is rightâ€”for with sufficient time, an elf who has mastered the secrets of high magic can accomplish almost anything...</p>
