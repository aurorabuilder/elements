			<p><strong>Shape the Battle to your Will!</strong></p>
			<p>You combine a talent for magic with a study of the art of war. As a battle mage, you know that fire and lightning can decimate an enemy’s forces; but a well-placed defense, the quick movement of allies, and a curse that crushes the enemy’s will to fight can be even more devastating. Battle magic is not just about killing your enemy: your true power is in controlling the flow of combat.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Battle Magic brings the secrets of battle magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>8 new feats, including Battlecaster, Eldritch Lifesaver, Elemental Trapper, and Merciful Caster</li>
				<li>25 new spells, including hobble mount, instant fortification, outflanking boon, and thunderous wave</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The wind is rising, and the enemy approaches. They’ve come ready for battle; but what they don’t know is that you are the master of the battlefield…</p>
