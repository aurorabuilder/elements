			<p><strong>Shape the Battle to your Will!</strong></p>
			<p>You combine a talent for magic with a study of the art of war. As a battle mage, you know that fire and lightning can decimate an enemy’s forces; but a well-placed defense, the quick movement of allies, and a curse that crushes the enemy’s will to fight can be even more devastating. Battle magic is not just about killing your enemy: your true power is in controlling the flow of combat.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Battle Magic brings the secrets of battle magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>8 new feats, including Battlecaster, Eldritch Lifesaver, Elemental Trapper, and Merciful Caster</li>
				<li>25 new spells, including hobble mount, instant fortification, outflanking boon, and thunderous wave</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The wind is rising, and the enemy approaches. They’ve come ready for battle; but what they don’t know is that you are the master of the battlefield…</p>

			<p>Regardless of the time of day or location of your battle, you command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats to your allies. Shafts of bright moonlight, each 5 feet wide, shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all threats within range, whether they’re enemies seen or unseen, or traps or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s soft glow.</p>
			<p class="indent">The glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but it does mark the invisible creature’s general location (somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light moves with targets while the effect lasts, but targets that move out of the spell’s range are no longer illuminated. New threats are not revealed as they enter the range or as you move; only those that were within 90 feet of you when the spell was cast are illuminated.</p>

The affected creature takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 radiant damage immediately when it bursts into flame. If the affected creature is wearing (or is made of) flammable material, it also catches on fire and continues burning; it takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the burning creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.</p>

If the target fails an Intelligence saving throw, then for the spell’s duration, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks made to direct a battle, determine tactics, or give directions or orders to other creatures. Additionally, each time the target gives commands, directions, or orders to other creatures, those creatures must roll a d4 and subtract the result from their Initiative as they struggle to comprehend and implement the confusing new directions. This applies to command abilities such as the orc war chief ’s Battle Cry and the hobgoblin warlord’s Leadership.</p>

			<p>Through this spell, you transform a miniature statuette of a keep into an actual fort. The fortification springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It is a 10-foot cube (including floor and roof). The walls are made of stone (AC 15), have 120 hit points each, and are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing a wall to 0 hit points destroys it and has a 50 percent chance to cause the roof to collapse.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes a metal door with an arcane lock. You designate at the time of the fort’s creation which creatures can enter the fortification. The door has AC 20 and 60 hit points, or it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for every slot level above 5th. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.</p>

			<p>Through this spell, you instantly transform raw materials into a siege engine (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details). You can collect the raw materials before casting this spell, or you can target other creatures that have the raw materials in their possession, as long as everything needed is within the spell’s range. The raw materials for the spell don’t need to be the actual material a siege weapon is normally built from; they just need to be remotely like that and have a value in gold at least equal to the weapon’s hit points. (For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege weapon will fashion any collection of raw material worth at least 100 gp into a mangonel, whether that’s a small house, three wagons, or two heavy crossbows.) The siege weapon is limited to a maximum size of Large (no siege towers or trebuchets). The spell also creates enough ammunition for ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level, a Huge siege engine can be made; at 8th level, a Gargantuan siege engine can be made. In addition, for each slot level above 4th, the spell creates another ten shots’ worth of ammunition.</p>

			<p>You join your life force to that of up to five allies.

The injured creature heals hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and the hit points remaining in the pool decrease by the same amount. This can be repeated until all the hit points in the pool are gone or the spell’s duration expires.</p>
