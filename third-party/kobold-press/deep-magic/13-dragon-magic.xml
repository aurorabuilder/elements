			<p><strong>Magic that Roils in Blood and Bone!</strong></p>
			<p>The dragons were among the first creatures to master all types of magic: controlling the elements, enchanting their lairs with innate defenses, and teaching their arts to their humanoid servants.</p>
			<p>Today, their kin—true dragons and lesser creatures—are heirs to this powerful magic. Kobolds serving great wyrms learn spells that harness their innate draconic natures. A human with an ancient draconic ancestor might find a wizard mentor to help her focus her power. Special legions of dragonborn troops train with a master dragon mage to better defend their homeland from invaders.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Dragon Magic brings the secrets of dragon magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A dragon mage arcane tradition that grants wizards draconic aspects as they rise in level</li>
				<li>9 new feats including Find The Titan’s Weakness, Dragonsmith, and Dragonrider</li>
				<li>16 new spells, including draconic smite, kobold’s fury, enhance greed, legend killer, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is magic born in the abyss of time, in an ancient age where titanic winged masters wielded unimaginable power. Their blood burns within you—unlock its secrets, and wield the magic that is your birthright!</p>

		<supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Wizards practice the subtle magic of pulling power from thin air and shaping it to fit their needs. Sorcerers tame the chaotic power within themselves, releasing it in barely controlled gouts of magical energy. Mages who walk the path between these two sources of magic are called dragon magi, and they meld the order of dweomery with the chaos of sorcery to grant themselves power that either tradition could never muster alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Dragon magi manifest their magic in many styles as diverse as the draconic species and the types of magic that populate the worlds. Kobolds serving as councilors to great wyrms are taught by their masters to harness their innate draconic natures through the use of more traditional spells. A wild-eyed human, oozing sorcerous magic from an ancient draconic ancestor, might find a kindly wizard to help her focus her power. Special legions of dragonborn troops train with a master dragon mage, learning all there is to know to better defend their homeland from invaders.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a magical dragon mask. The dragon mask is translucent magical force in the form of a dragon’s head that sits atop your shoulders and surrounds your head. Your face is still visible beneath the mask, which does not hinder your vision. To create the mask, you take a bonus action and expend a spell slot.

The dragon mask remains until its duration ends, you become incapacitated, or you use a bonus action to dismiss it or replace it with another dragon aspect.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you wear your dragon mask, you gain the following benefits and drawbacks.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
				<li>You gain a bite attack. As an action, make a melee spell attack against an adjacent target. On a hit, the target takes (1d8 + your Int modifier) piercing damage. This counts as a magical attack for purposes of overcoming a target’s immunity or resistance to piercing damage.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</li>
				<li>You make ranged and melee spell attacks with disadvantage, and your targets have advantage on their saving throws against your spells.</li>
				<li>As a bonus action, you can expend an additional spell slot to augment your dragon mask. Your next bite attack is made with advantage and does an additional 1d8 piercing damage per level of the spell slot expended.</li>

The cost to create these items is ten times the normal cost of the item. The number and type of items that can be made from a particular dragon’s corpse is up to the GM, but considering how much violence must be inflicted on a dragon to bring it down, the amount of salvageable raw matieral is low; dragons don’t die from superficial damage.</p>

The resulting weapon, in the hands of a proficient wielder, does an additional 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the dragon whose body was used to create the weapon.

			<p class="indent">Any type of armor can be made except padded or chain (shirt or mail).

		<description>
			<p>You can detect the presence of dragons and other draconic creatures within your line of sight and 120 feet, regardless of disguises, illusions, and alteration magic such as polymorph. The information you uncover depends on the number of consecutive rounds you spend an action studying a subject or area. On the first round of examination, you detect whether any draconic creatures are present, but not their number, location, identiy, or type. On the second round, you learn the number of such creatures as well as the general condition of the most powerful one. On the third and subsequent rounds, you make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check; if it succeeds, you learn the age, type, and location of one draconic creature. Note that the spell provides no information on the turn it’s cast unless you have the means to take a second action that turn.</p>
