			<p><strong>Dark Power From the Realm of Shadow</strong></p>
			<p>Let others wonder what dangers lurk within the shadows: you learned long ago that the true power is shadow itself. Through deep study and practice—or a long-ago mark on your bloodline—you can draw mysterious, unsettling energy from the alien dimension known as the Shadow Realm, and turn it to your own use.</p>
			<p>Those who fear the shadows, also fear you. Let them.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Shadow Magic brings the secrets of shadow magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Shadow Bloodline sorcerous origin, with Tainted Shadows, Evil Eye, Dark Illusions, and more</li>
				<li>The Light-Eater: a new warlock patron, with new pact boons</li>
				<li>A new Whisper roguish archtype, with new abilities including Dark Trickery, Shadow Road, and Misdirection</li>
				<li>20 new spells, including banshee wail, claws of darkness, malevolent waves, umbral storm, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where darkness brings dread to others, for you it brings a fierce joy and a surge of power. The shadows are your dominion; and by drawing upon them, you become a force to be reckoned with!</p>
