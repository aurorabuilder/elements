			<p><strong>Dark Power From the Realm of Shadow</strong></p>
			<p>Let others wonder what dangers lurk within the shadows: you learned long ago that the true power is shadow itself. Through deep study and practice—or a long-ago mark on your bloodline—you can draw mysterious, unsettling energy from the alien dimension known as the Shadow Realm, and turn it to your own use.</p>
			<p>Those who fear the shadows, also fear you. Let them.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Shadow Magic brings the secrets of shadow magic into your 5th Edition campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Shadow Bloodline sorcerous origin, with Tainted Shadows, Evil Eye, Dark Illusions, and more</li>
				<li>The Light-Eater: a new warlock patron, with new pact boons</li>
				<li>A new Whisper roguish archtype, with new abilities including Dark Trickery, Shadow Road, and Misdirection</li>
				<li>20 new spells, including banshee wail, claws of darkness, malevolent waves, umbral storm, and more</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where darkness brings dread to others, for you it brings a fierce joy and a surge of power. The shadows are your dominion; and by drawing upon them, you become a force to be reckoned with!</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your magic always acts a bit differently than that of other casters. Your magical fire burns with a deep purple flame that sheds little light but casts inky shadows. The influence of the Shadow Realm can be seen in every manifestation of your magic, whether that’s shadowy bonds tightening around the target of a hold person spell or the shadows that swirl like storm clouds inside your dimension door. At 1st level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. Within that range, you see through magical darkness as if it were dim light.</p>

			<p>You pull pieces of the Shadow Realm into your own reality, causing a 20-foot cube to fill with inky ribbons that turn the area into difficult terrain and wrap around nearby creatures. Any creature that ends its turn in the area becomes restrained by the shadow ribbons until the end of its next turn unless it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. Once a creature makes this saving throw successfully, it can’t be restrained again by these black ribbons, but it’s still affected by the difficult terrain.</p>
