			<p><strong>Magic Measured in Moments—and Eternities!</strong></p>
			<p>The control and manipulation of time is an esoteric and mysterious branch of magic. Spellcasters who seek to alter time have the potential to perform incredible deeds. That potential is tempered by the great danger of intervening with time, which resists mortal interference. Deep Magic: Time Magicbrings the secrets of temporal magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A divine option for the Time Domain and a Timekeeper arcane tradition for wizards</li>
				<li>A Lost Traveller Background for those who wander in time</li>
				<li>12 new spells, including accelerate, chronal lance, time loop, and wall of time</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Mastery of time itself brings immense power to the caster, but runs enormous risks--not least attracting the attention of archmages and the gods themselves for your meddling! Seize this power boldly, and with respect for the dangers it contains!</p>

			<p>Most spellcasters and sages agree that significant alterations to time are undesirable, but they disagree strongly on what constitutes a significant alteration. As might be expected, those of Good alignment typically try to protect time from those who seek to make significant changes or bend time to their will, while those of Evil alignment try to change what’s passed for their own selfish purposes.</p>

			<p>By touching an object, you retrieve another version of the object from elsewhere in time. If the object is attended, you must succeed on a melee spell attack roll against the creature holding or controlling the object. Any effect that affects the original object also affects the duplicate (charges spent, damage taken, etc.) and any effect that affects the duplicate also affects the original object. If either object is destroyed, both are destroyed. This spell does not affect sentient items or unique artifacts.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You slow the flow of time around a creature. The creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or its speed is halved (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment). Until the effect ends, the creature’s speed is halved again at the start of each of your turns. For example, a character with a speed of 30 feet fails its saving throw, dropping its speed to 15 feet. At the start of your next turn, the creature’s speed drops to 10 feet, then to 5 feet on the following round. Decelerate can’t reduce a creature’s speed to less than 5 feet. The spell ends after 1 minute or when the target uses its action to make a successful Wisdom saving throw.</p>

			<p>You capture the target in a loop of time. The creature is teleported to the space where it began its previous turn. The target then makes a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell’s effect ends. If it fails, the creature must repeat the actions it took on its previous turn, following the same sequence of moves and actions to the best of its ability. It doesn’t need to move along the same path or attack the same target, but if it moved, then attacked, on its previous turn, its only option is to move, then attack, this turn. If the space where the target began its previous turn is occupied or it’s impossible for the target to take the same action (if it cast a spell but it’s now unable to do so, for example), the target is incapacitated.</p>
			<p class="indent">An affected target repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. For as long as the duration lasts, the target teleports back to its starting point at the start of each of its turns and it must repeat the same sequence of moves and actions.</p>

			<p>This spell destabilizes the flow of time in the target area, subjecting creatures caught in the vortex to temporal fluctuations that are visible as a spherical distortion with a 10-foot radius. Each creature within the sphere when you cast the spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the time vortex.
