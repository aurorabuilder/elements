		<description>
			<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the fertility and abundance of animal life and every being’s place in the chain of life.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You have advantage when making ability or skill checks to identify creatures.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> You can quickly trace this glyph into the air (1 action) and stare down a beast or monstrosity. The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature is frightened of you for as long as you continue staring at it. While frightened of you, the creature must move its full movement away from you on each of its turns until you can’t see it anymore or it makes a successful saving throw. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. When the creature makes a successful saving throw (regardless of whether it failed previously), it has disadvantage on its attacks against you until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power:</strong> By carving this glyph into the bone of an animal and crushing the bone, you can grant yourself a measure of the animal’s power. You gain one of the following: a climb or swim speed of 30 feet, or a fly or burrow speed of 20 feet, whichever is most appropriate to the type of animal the bone came from. The effect lasts for 1 hour, so long as you maintain concentration.</p>

			<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents gifts, knowledge, secrets, and things hidden.</p>

			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power:</strong> By spending 1 minute in concentration while holding a papyrus reed, you can cast the spell speak with inanimate object (see “Hieroglyph Spells”).</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (4th Level):</strong> By breaking open an egg (1 action), you create an extradimensional space (a “silver coffer”) large enough to hold 10 pounds of material. This looks like a simple, empty hole in the ground, but when you reach inside it, you always find whatever you placed inside. The extradimensional space remains visible as a hole in the ground for 24 hours, then disappears along with whatever is inside it. It can be reopened with another use of this hieroglyph power. The silver coffer’s location in the Material Plane depends on your location when you trigger the hieroglyph. This power always opens the same extradimensional space no matter how much time passes or how far you travel between uses, so it’s not a good means to dispose of (for example) unwanted or dangerous magic items. If the person who created the extradimensional space dies, any items in his or her silver coffer eventually return to their plane of origin at a random location, anytime from a day to several centuries after the creator’s death.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (10th Level):</strong> By rubbing a special brown paste over your eyes that costs 50 gp (1 action), you cast true seeing on yourself.</p>

			<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> This symbol represents the prevention of harm, usually through the protection of devoted soldiers or bodyguards.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> When unarmored, your Armor Class = (10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier).</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (3rd Level):</strong> By drawing this hieroglyph with powdered metal on a creature (1 action), you grant that creature resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice) for 1 minute.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (5th Level):</strong> By burning a specially crafted scroll (1 action), you conjure a squad of soldiers. These soldiers can appear different to different creatures, and even have different numbers (one person might see five soldiers while another sees eight). They appear standing inside a 10-foot square within 10 feet of you, and they can’t leave that space. Within that square area, they behave like a swarm; other creatures can enter the space and end their turn there. Whenever one of your enemies enters the soldiers’ space or starts its turn in the space or within 5 feet of it, the soldiers attack that creature. Their attack bonus = (your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier), and a successful attack causes 7 (2d6) force damage. The soldiers remain for 1 minute, provided you maintain concentration on them. They never take damage and can’t be dispelled except by breaking your concentration.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power (8th Level):</strong> By tracing this hieroglyph into the air and then limning it with a handful of magically-charged sand (1 action), you cast banishment.</p>

			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Bonus:</strong> You gain a +1 bonus when making Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>
			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Power (3rd Level):</strong> To trigger this hieroglyph, you must trace the symbol on yourself with a knife or other sharp object (pressing hard enough to leave a mark on the skin but not hard enough to cause damage or draw blood) and emit a loud battle cry.

			<p><strong>Hieroglyph Mastery Power:</strong> By hosting a great feast for your army on the eve of battle, everyone who partakes in the feast gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) and has advantage on the same number of their next attacks. At least 500 gp worth of gold shavings must be cooked into the food. The effects fade when used or at sunset of the next day.</p>

Within minutes after the spell is cast, the target feels constant hunger no matter how much food is consumed. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against the spell after every 24 hours during the spell’s duration. Each time the saving throw fails, the target gains one level of exhaustion. The effect ends after 1 week or when the target’s Constitution saving throw succeeds for a second day in a row.</p>

			<p>By touching a recently deceased corpse, you gain one specific bit of knowledge from it that was known to the creature in life. You must form a question in your mind as part of casting the spell; if the corpse has an answer to your question, it reveals the information to you. The answer is always brief—no more than a sentence—and very specific to the framed question. The corpse doesn’t need a functioning mouth to speak its answer; you receive the information telepathically. It doesn’t matter whether the creature was your friend or enemy; the spell compels it to answer in any case.</p>

		<supports>Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you erect a barrier of energy from the realm of death and shadow. This creates a wall 20 feet high and 60 feet long, or a ring 20 feet high and 20 feet in diameter. The wall lightly obscures vision through it from one side of your choice but is transparent from the other side. A creature that tries to move through the wall must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the wall until the start of the creature’s next turn, when it can try again to move through. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against the wall, it’s immune to being frightened of this gloomwrought barrier.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast mire, you create a 10-foot-diameter pit of quicksand, sticky mud, or a similar dangerous natural hazard suited to the region. A creature that’s in the area when the spell is cast or that enters the affected area must make a successful Strength saving throw or sink up to its waist and be restrained by the mire. From that point on, the mire acts exactly as quicksand (see the GM’s rules), but the DC for Strength checks to escape from the quicksand is your spell save DC. A character outside the mire trying to pull another creature free receives a +5 bonus on their Strength check against that DC.</p>

			<p>This small golden box resembles a jewelry box and is easily mistaken for a common trinket. When attuned to the box, its owner can fill the box with mental images of important events lasting no more than a minute each. Any number of memories can be stored this way. These images are similar to a slide show from the bearer’s point of view. On a command from its owner, the box projects a mental image of a requested memory so that whoever is holding the box at that moment can see it.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a coffer of memory is found with memories already stored inside it, a newly-attuned owner can view a randomly-selected stored memory with a successful DC 14 Charisma check.</p>
