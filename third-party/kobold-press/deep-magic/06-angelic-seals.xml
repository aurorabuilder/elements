			<p><strong>Call Down the Deep Magic of the Heavens!</strong></p>
			<p>The heavenly planes shine with light and power, where deities both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. The most powerful of their servants are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels is hidden within those names—and you have learned to tap that potential!</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Angelic Seals brings the secrets of angelic magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new Angelic Scribe arcane tradition, with 10 angelic seals that bind the power of celestial messengers through their names</li>
				<li>New angelic magic feats: Heavenly Scribe and Heaven’s Chosen</li>
				<li>10 new spells, including angelic guardian, blade of wrath, seal of sanctuary, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the ages since the first angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles between light and darkness have tested the limits of the heavenly host. Will you join the struggle to protect the righteous? Or tempt angelic wrath with your pursuit of power?</p>

			<p>You study the angelic seals that bind the power of celestial messengers through their names, and you shape that power into magical effects. Beyond the seals and wardings themselves, you learn esoteric spells to call down the essence of the angelic host. Most angelic scribes take up their craft out of reverence and a desire to protect the righteous; a few tempt angelic wrath with their lust for power that’s otherwise beyond their grasp.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Seals.</em></strong> You learn two angelic seals of your choice, which are detailed below under “Angelic Seals.” You can spend 10 minutes scribing an angelic seal you know on paper, canvas, stone tiles, or some other token that can be carried or displayed. Alternatively, you can spend 8 hours using appropriate artisan tools to carve or etch a more permanent seal into harder material. Once you have a seal, you can activate it as an action.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can have one active seal at a time. The number of active seals you can maintain increases by 1 at 6th level (2 seals), 10th level (3 seals), and 14th level (4 seals). As a bonus action, you can deactivate a seal. A broken or defaced seal deactivates immediately.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can gain the benefits of one active seal it holds or openly wears. The seal’s delicate magic is suppressed while its user concentrates on a spell or a similar effect. A suppressed seal still counts against your total number of active seals allowed.</p>
			<p class="indent">You learn one additional angelic seal of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Each time you learn a new seal, you can also replace one seal you know with a different one.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 6th level, you learn to place warding seals to protect areas. This follows the same rules for scribing an angelic seal, but the seal must be on the ground, the floor, or a similarly solid portion of a structure such as a wall, column, or ceiling. As an action, you can touch the seal to activate it. You must maintain concentration on the effect as if concentrating on a spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once activated, the warding seal creates a spiritual, spherical boundary with a radius of 30 feet, or surrounding a small building or series of rooms of similar dimension (a 22-foot cube, for example, or any space of approximately 11,000 cubic feet). Aberrations, fey, fiends, and undead cannot physically cross that boundary, cast spells across it, or project their abilities across it unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature that fails the saving throw can try again on its next turn. A creature that succeeds and moves across the boundary into the protected area isn’t affected by the boundary while it remains inside (the boundary impedes only incoming entities and effects, not outgoing), but it must contend with the ward again if it leaves the area.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature can see the seal when it makes the saving throw, it has disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when a creature you can see and who is carrying an active seal is targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>

			<p>You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade it disappears, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Calling upon the might of the angels, you conjure a flaming chariot made of gold and mithral in an unoccupied space you can see within range. Two horses made of fire and light pull the chariot. You and up to three other Medium or smaller creatures you designate can board the chariot (at the cost of 5 feet of movement) and are unharmed by the flames. Any other creature who touches the chariot or hits it or a creature riding in it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the chariot takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The chariot is AC 18, has 50 hit points, is immune to fire, poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and is resistant to all other nonmagical damage. The horses are not separate creatures but are part of the chariot. The chariot vanishes if it’s reduced to 0 hit points, and any creature riding it falls. The chariot has a speed of 50 feet and a fly speed of 40 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">On your turn, you can guide the chariot in place of your own movement. You can direct it to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge by using your bonus action. As an action, you can cause the chariot to overrun creatures in its path. For the remainder of the turn, the chariot can enter a hostile creature’s space. The creature takes damage as if it touched the chariot and must make a successful Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>

			<p>A nimbus of golden light surrounds your head for the duration. The halo sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This spell grants you a pool of 10 points of healing. When you cast the spell and as an action on subsequent turns during the spell’s duration, you can expend points from this pool to restore an equal number of lost hit points to one creature within the spell’s bright light that you can see.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against good creatures within the light shed by the halo.</p>
			<p class="indent">If any of this spell’s area overlaps an area of magical darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s pool of healing increases by 5 points for each spell slot above 2nd and this spell dispels darkness spells of a level equal to the slot used in casting blessed halo.</p>

		<supports>Cleric,Paladin,Warlock,Wizard,Angelic Magic</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, floor, or other solid component of a structure. The seal creates a spherical, spiritual boundary with a radius of 100 feet. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead who approach within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to cross a deadly barrier. If the creature comes into contact with the boundary, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes 15d8 radiant damage, it’s repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and it can’t target anything on the opposite side of the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed instead of taking damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary.</p>
			<p class="indent">While within 100 feet of the seal (inside the boundary), aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each takes 4d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">All of these effects apply to the specified creatures trying to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel.</p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 100 feet of the seal.</p>
			<p class="indent">The seal has 75 hit points, has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and is immune to psychic and poison damage. If the seal is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</p>

			<p>By calling on an archangel, you become infused with celestial essence and take on angelic features such as golden skin, glowing eyes, and ethereal wings. For the duration of the spell, your AC can’t be less than 20, you can’t be frightened, and you are immune to necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, each hostile creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of you or enters that area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature frightened in this way is restrained. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the frightening effect of the spell until you cast quintessence again.</p>
