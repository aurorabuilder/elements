			<p><strong>Call Down the Deep Magic of the Heavens!</strong></p>
			<p>The heavenly planes shine with light and power, where deities both benevolent and stern look down from their thrones. The most powerful of their servants are mighty beyond mortal ken, and their very names seethe with the essence of creation. The secrets of harnessing the power of the angels is hidden within those names—and you have learned to tap that potential!</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Angelic Seals brings the secrets of angelic magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A new Angelic Scribe arcane tradition, with 10 angelic seals that bind the power of celestial messengers through their names</li>
				<li>New angelic magic feats: Heavenly Scribe and Heaven’s Chosen</li>
				<li>10 new spells, including angelic guardian, blade of wrath, seal of sanctuary, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the ages since the first angelic names were carved into earthly forms, the battles between light and darkness have tested the limits of the heavenly host. Will you join the struggle to protect the righteous? Or tempt angelic wrath with your pursuit of power?</p>
