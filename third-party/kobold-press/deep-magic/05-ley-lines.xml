		<description>
			<p>While any spellcaster can tap the potential coursing through ley lines, the tradition of geomancy teaches the art of becoming like a ley line and bonding with the great flow of power. Geomancy is sometimes looked down on by adherents of traditions that focus on individual magic schools because it eschews specialization in favor of molding any form of magic through the focused power of ley lines.</p>
			<p class="indent">Geomancers have an increased facility for tapping into any ley line, but they also learn to bind themselves to a specific ley line. While other spellcasters must be within a ley line’s area of influence to use it, the geomancer becomes a tributary of his or her chosen river of power, capable of siphoning its power anywhere.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Spellcasters can tap ley lines to fill their spells with sudden bursts of power. While this can be dangerous, a skilled caster can create fantastic effects with extra power.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ley lines vary in intensity from weak trickles to titanic torrents of mystical power. In general, the more intense the ley line, the more potent its effect on magic and the more difficult it is to tap into.</p>
			<p class="indent">They are also classified as either unlocked or locked. These two categories are subjective; a ley line is locked only to individual spellcasters who’ve locked it, while it remains unlocked to all others. Locked ley lines produce predictable, repeatable benefits when worked into magic. Unlocked ley lines are no more difficult to tap into than locked ones (of the same intensity), but they are unpredictable and dangerous to use. They also bleed magical energy into the surrounding environment, which sometimes causes strange, unnatural effects in the neighborhood.</p>
			<p class="indent">To tap the potential of a ley line requires specialized knowledge, represented by either the Ley Initiate feat or the Geomancy arcane tradition. If your game doesn’t utilize optional feats, you can instead allow a spellcaster who has a geomancer tutor or who has access to ample research material to learn the technique for tapping ley lines via training as a downtime activity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once a spellcaster understands how to access the energy of a ley line, the procedure is straightforward. When a spell is cast within 30 feet of a ley line, the spellcaster can tap the line’s power to augment his or her magic. This requires a successful ability check using the caster’s spellcasting ability but without including any proficiency bonus. The DC of the check equals 10 + the level of the spell being cast. A successful check harnesses the power of the ley line, and the spell is modified according to the line’s intensity (weak, strong, or titanic). If the check fails but the result is within 4 of the DC, the spell is cast normally with no bonus effect and no penalty. If the check fails by 5 or more, the spell is cast normally but the spellcaster suffers backlash (see below).</p>
			<p class="indent">When a ley line is tapped successfully, the effect depends on whether the line is locked or unlocked. A locked ley line always has the same effect for the spellcaster who locked it. An unlocked ley line is unpredictable; every time it’s tapped, the player rolls 1d10 and consults the table corresponding to the ley line’s intensity (weak, strong, or titanic).</p>

			<p>You create a 15-foot-radius sphere filled with disruptive ley energy. The sphere is centered around a point you can see within range. Surfaces inside the sphere shift erratically, becoming difficult terrain for the duration. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. If you cast this spell in an area within the influence of a ley line, creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws against its effect.</p>

			<p>A roiling stormcloud of ley energy forms, centered around a point you can see and extending horizontally to a radius of 360 feet, with a thickness of 30 feet. Shifting color shoots through the writhing cloud, and thunder roars out of it. Each creature under the cloud at the moment when it’s created (no more than 5,000 feet beneath it) takes 2d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 5 minutes; a successful Constitution saving throw negates both effects.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Round 5-10.</em></strong> Flashes of multicolored light burst through and out of the cloud, causing creatures to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while they are beneath the cloud. In addition, each round, you trigger a burst of energy that fills a 20-foot sphere centered on a point you can see beneath the cloud.
