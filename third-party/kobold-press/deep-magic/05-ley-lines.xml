			<p><strong>Draw Upon The Deep Magic of the Land!</strong></p>
			<p>Magic flows like an invisible river, wending across the landscape. Most cannot see the ley lines; but to you, trained in the arts of geomancy, they blaze as glowing torrents of energy, pulsing bands of light, glittering strings. This power, the power of the land itself, is yours to draw upon.</p>
			<p>Deep Magic: Ley Lines brings the secrets of ley line magic into your 5e campaign, featuring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Random tables for the effects of weak, strong, and titanic ley lines on your spells, as well as ley line backlash</li>
				<li>Two new feats—Ley Initiate and Ley-Bound—and a new Geomancy arcane tradition</li>
				<li>Using ley lines in the Midgard Campaign Setting</li>
				<li>15 new spells, including ley storm, land bond, ray of life suppression, volley shield, and more!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The wise see the world as it truly is: a shimmering net of flowing magic. Plunge your hands into its torrents, and charge your spells with unfathomable power!</p>
