            <p>You animate droplets of your own blood to act under your command. For every three hit points expended in the casting of this spell, you create a droplet of animated blood.</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the droplets to move as long as they are within 120 feet of you. The droplets have a speed of 30 feet, and a climbing speed of 15 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action on your turn, you can choose to see and hear from the location of one of the blood droplets until the end of your turn, becoming blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. Additionally, you may instead use your action to cause one of the droplets to explode in a burst of necromantic energy, destroying the droplet and damaging surrounding creatures. Each creature within 5 feet of the droplet must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 5d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><span class="feature">At Higher Levels. </span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases to 6d4. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases to 7d4. When you use a 9th level spell slot, the damage increases to 8d4.</p>

            <p>You create a 15-foot cube of shadow magic centered on a point within range. The area appears to be wreathed in swirling shadows and darkness, and is easily identifiable when it is in an area of bright or dim light. The sphere spreads around corners, and each creature within the radius becomes invisible at the start of each of their turns. This invisibility ends if they attack, cast a spell, or leave the area. Anything they are wearing or carrying is also invisible as long as they are.</p>

            <p>You release a mournful wail that pierces into the mind of those that hear it. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 psychic damage, and falls unconscious. On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no other effect. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake them awake. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.</p>

            <p>Necromantic energy emanates from you in a 30-foot radius area. Until the spell ends, the area moves with you, centered on you. While within the area, you and every creature that you have under your control (such as through an <i>animate dead</i> spell) gains 2d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of their turns. These temporary hit points last until they leave the area.</p>

You gain a number of temporary equal to the amount expended. For as long as these temporary hit points last, whenever a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you they become poisoned for 1 minute.

            <p>This spell dominates the minds and bodies of humanoids, consuming them in a frenzy of death and destruction. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. Roll 14d8 and add double the number of hit points expended to the roll; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Humanoids within 30 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).</p>
            <p class="indent">Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is under your control until the spell ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can issue commands to the creatures under your control, directing them where to move and attack. If a creature doesn’t receive orders from you, they attack the closest creature to them. If a creature hasn’t made an attack by the end of their turn, the spell ends for them.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, each creature that is still under the spell’s effect when the spell ends dies.</p>

        <description>
            <p>When you cast this spell, you bury a humanoid hand into a patch of loose earth at least 5 feet in diameter to conceal it. The area is nearly undisturbed and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>
            <p class="indent">The hand animates when a medium or smaller creature walks over the area of earth. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the spell could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the spell, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the hand animates, it attempts to grab whatever creature triggered it. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and become restrained as the hand grasps it with an inhumanly strong grip. The creature can use an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. Once the hand has animated for 1 minute, the spell ends, and the hand returns to normal. If the creature dies while restrained, the hand pulls it underground, burying it.</p>

            <p>You compel shadows to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The shadow of a creature or object changes size or shape, up to a maximum of double or half its normal size. This effect lasts for up to 1 minute, or until it moves.</li>
                <li>You cause shadows to conceal a creature in dim light or darkness, giving them advantage on their next Dexterity (Stealth) check within the next minute as long as they remain in the dim light or darkness.</li>
                <li>A creature or object’s shape becomes either harder or softer, making its form either easier or harder to discern from the shape of the shadow. This effect lasts for up to 1 hour.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>

            <p>You draw out a portion of your own blood as you kiss another humanoid. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you for 10 minutes for every hit point spent on the casting of the spell, ending early if you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature falls hopelessly in love with you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A wall of writhing bones and skeletons springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of three 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). Any creature that starts its turn next to a wall must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and become restrained. The creature can make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking the same damage on a failure or freeing itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it.</p>
