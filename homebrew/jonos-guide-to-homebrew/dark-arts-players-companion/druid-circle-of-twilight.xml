            <p>The Circle of Twilight is an ancient sect of druids, long estranged from other druidic circles due to their differing outlooks on the natural world. The Circle of Twilight believes that the spirits of nature need regular sacrifices of beasts, natural and unnatural, and even the occasional human sacrifice. These druids meet in old, dying forests to perform secret blood rituals - rituals which they hope will appease the cruelest gods of the Old Faith. As a member of this circle, you realize nature’s will is not of kindness and spirituality - it is of cruelty and sacrifice.</p>

            <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn how to perform rituals using the blood sacrifices of powerful foes. By using the body of a creature that has died within the last hour as one of your spell components, you can cast any spell with the ritual tag from any class spell list without needing to prepare it. You still need to use the other components of the ritual as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">In order to cast a ritual in this manner, you need the body of a creature of a CR greater than or equal to the spell level of the ritual to be cast, and the spell must be of a level you have spell slots for. The creature used cannot be a construct, an undead, or an elemental. Once you complete the ritual, that creature cannot be used in any other rituals.</p>

            <p>The dark powers of twilight infuse you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to a number of circle spells, listed below in the twilight table.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

            <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to see the souls of living creatures. As an action on your turn, you hone your senses to allow you to see the faint outline of any living creature or creature that has died within the last hour. This allows you to see any creature within the radius of your darkvision, including invisible creatures, as well as creatures that are obscured in some manner, such as being behind a wall or in murky water. This sight can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. The magical sight lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you cast a ritual using your ritual sacrifice feature, the CR of the creature only needs to be half of the spell level of the ritual to be cast, and you may use the same creature in up to two different rituals.</p>
