        <description>
            <p>You have made a pact with an archlich, a creature that has existed since the dawn of the last age and holds secrets of arcane magic that have been forgotten for thousands of years. Such a being desires only to expand its own power and influence, only using you as a pawn in its far larger scheme. Any lich powerful enough to form a pact has lived for many thousands of years, and many of them were involved in the invention of lichdom itself.</p>
            <h5>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</h5>
            <p class="indent">The Archlich lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p>
