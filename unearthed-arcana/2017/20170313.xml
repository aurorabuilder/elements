	<element name="Mystic" type="Class" source="Unearthed Arcana: The Mystic Class" id="ID_WOTC_UA20170313_CLASS_MYSTIC">
		<description>
			<p>A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion’s slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.</p>
			<p class="indent">The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs’ charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings to the orcs’ minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.</p>
			<p class="indent">Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke’s men arrived to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.</p>
			<p class="indent">These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.</p>
			<h4>HERMITS AND OUTCASTS</h4>
			<p>Mystics are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.</p>
			<p class="indent">In order to master their power, mystics must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live as hermits at the edge of society. A mystic who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight</p>
			<p class="indent">When mystics finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft. Some mystics prefer to remain isolated, but those who become adventurers aren’t content to remain on the fringe of the world.</p>
			<h4>ECCENTRIC MINDS</h4>
			<p>In order to maintain the strict discipline and intense self-knowledge needed to tap into their power, mystics develop a variety of practices to keep their focus sharp.</p>
			<p class="indent">These practices are reflected in taboos and quirks, strange little behaviors that govern a mystic’s actions. These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep mystics in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over their minds and bodies.</p>
			<p class="indent">While these taboos are harmless, they help cast mystics as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it. To mystics, the life of the mind is where they feel most at home.</p>
			<h5>Selecting Quirks</h5>
			<p>To add some texture to your mystic, consider the quirks your character has acquired. These behaviors have no game effect, but your character might become irritated or upset if forced to break them. They’re a great roleplaying tool to add character to the game. You can roll on or pick from the table below, or create your own quirks. Aim to create two quirks, to give them more of a chance to come into play. Finally, consider why your character chose these behaviors. What do they say about your character’s personality or background? Are they based on a specific incident or a belief?</p>
			<h5>Mystic Quirks</h5>

			<h4>CREATING A MYSTIC</h4>
			<p>When creating a mystic, consider your character’s background. How did you become a mystic? What first drew you to this practice? Are you self-taught, or did you have a master? If you had a master, what is that relationship like?</p>
			<p class="indent">Consider also why you returned to the world from your hermitage. Did you leave someone or something behind when you took up your studies? Are you driven by revenge or some other motivation?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>

		<supports>Mystic</supports>
		<description>
			<p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of the is document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</p>
			<h5>PSIONIC TALENTS</h5>
			<p>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</p>
			<h5>PSIONIC DISCIPLINES</h5>
			<p>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</p>
			<h5>PSI POINTS</h5>
			<p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</p>
			<p class="indent">The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can’t go below 0 or over your maximum.</p>
			<h5>PSI LIMIT</h5>
			<p>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training	and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</p>
			<h5>PSYCHIC FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines.</p>
			<h5>PSIONIC ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<p class="indent">Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can’t also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven’t spent.</p>
			<p class="indent">If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn’t use these special points, the disciplines end that you’re concentrating on.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b>Crowned in Sorrow (1-7 psi).</b> As an action, one creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw.

			<p>You place a mote of pure fury within a creature’s mind, causing its bloodlust to overcome its senses and for it to act as you wish it to.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> While you are focused on this discipline, any enemy within 5 feet of you that makes a melee attack roll against creatures other than you does so with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Primal Fury (1-7 psi).</b> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability and immediately use its reaction to move its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Fighting Words (2 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b>  If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to leave a simmering violence in its mind. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature before your concentration ends, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Mindless Courage (2 psi).</b> You cause a creature's bloodlust to overcome its sense of preservation. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until the end of your next turn, it can’t willingly move unless its movement brings it closer to its nearest enemy that it can see. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Punishing Fury (5 psi; conc., 1 min.).</b> You cause a creature's rage to grow so hot that it attacks without heeding its own safety.

The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.</p>

			<p>You learn to use psionic energy to manipulate others with a subtle combination of psi and your own, natural charm.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> While focused on this discipline, you gain a bonus to Charisma checks. The bonus equals half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Charming Presence (1–7 psi).</b> As an action, you exert an aura of sympathetic power. Roll 2d8 per psi point spent on this ability; the total is how many hit points worth of creatures this option can affect. Creatures within 30 feet of you are affected in ascending order of their hit point maximums, ignoring incapacitated creatures, creatures immune to being charmed, and creatures engaged in combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Starting with the creature that has the lowest hit point maximum, each creature affected by this option is charmed by you for 10 minutes, regarding you as a friendly acquaintance. Subtract each creature’s hit point maximum from the total before moving on to the next creature. A creature’s hit point maximum must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Center of Attention (2 psi; conc., 1 min.).</b> As an action, you exert an aura of power that grabs a creature's attention. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is so thoroughly distracted by you that all other creatures are invisible to it until your concentration ends. This effect ends if the creature can no longer see or hear you or if it takes damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Invoke Awe (7 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> As an action, you exert an aura that inspires awe in others. Choose up to 5 creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be charmed by you until your concentration ends. While charmed, the target obeys all your verbal commands to the best of its ability and without doing anything obviously self -destructive. The charmed target will attack only creatures that it has seen attack you since it was charmed or that it was already hostile toward. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

			<p>Your mind becomes one with elemental water, attuning your thoughts to its ebb and flow.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> While focused on this discipline, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Desiccate (1–7 psi).</b> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 1d10 necrotic damage per psi point spent on this ability, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Watery Grasp (2 psi).</b> As an action, you unleash a wave that surges forth and then retreats to you like the rising tide. You create a wave in a 20-foot-by-20- foot square. At least some portion of the square’s border must be within 5 feet of you. Any creature in that square must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Water Whip (3 psi).</b> As an action, you unleash a jet of water in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, you can move each target that fails its saving throw to any unoccupied space touching the line. You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Water Breathing (5 psi).</b> As an action, you grant yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see within 60 feet of you the ability to breathe underwater for the next 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Water Sphere (6 psi; conc., 1 min.) .</b> As an action, you cause a sphere of water to form around a creature. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes trapped in the sphere of water until your concentration ends. While the target is trapped, its speed is halved, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and it can’t see anything more than 10 feet away from it. However, attack rolls against it also suffer disadvantage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Animate Water (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> As an action, you cause a water elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The elemental lasts until your concentration ends, and it obeys your verbal commands. In combat, roll for its initiative, and choose its behavior during its turns. When this effect ends, the elemental disappears. See the Monster Manual for its stat block.</p>

			<p>Your mind reaches into the sky, reshaping the stuff of storms to serve your needs.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Cloud Steps (1–7 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> As an action, you conjure forth clouds to create a solid, translucent staircase that lasts until your concentration ends. The stairs form a spiral that fills a 10-foot-by-10 -foot area and reaches upward 20 feet per psi point spent.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Hungry Lightning (1–7 psi).</b> As an action, you lash out at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you with tendrils of lightning. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it’s wearing heavy armor. The target takes 1d8 lightning damage per psi point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Clouds (2 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> As an action, you create a wall of clouds, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Creatures can pass through it without hindrance, but the wall blocks vision.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Whirlwind (2 psi).</b> As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Winds howl in a 20-foot- radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved to an unoccupied space of your choice in the sphere. Any loose object in the sphere is moved to an unoccupied space of your choice within it if the object weighs no more than 100 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Lightning Leap (5 psi).</b> As an action, you let loose a line of lightning that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can then teleport to an unoccupied space touched by the line.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Thunder (6 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> As an action, you create a wall of thunder, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Thunder Clap (7 psi).</b> As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Thunder energy erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 thunder damage, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>

			<p>You attune your mind to seize control of wood and earth.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> While focused on this discipline, you have a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Animate Weapon (1–7 psi).</b> As an action, your mind seizes control of a one -handed melee weapon you’re holding. The weapon flies toward one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and makes a one- handed melee weapon attack against it, using your discipline attack modifier for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the weapon deals its normal damage, plus an extra 1d10 force damage per psi point spent on this ability. The weapon returns to your grasp after it attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Warp Weapon (2 psi).</b> As an action, choose one nonmagical weapon held by one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or the chosen weapon can’t be used to attack until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Warp Armor (3 psi).</b> As an action, choose a nonmagical suit of armor worn by one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the creature’s AC becomes 10 + its Dexterity modifier until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Wall of Wood (3 psi; conc., 1 hr.) .</b> As an action, you create a wall of wood at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 5-foot wide section of the wall has AC 12 and 100 hit points. Breaking one section creates a 5 - foot by 5-foot hole in it, but the wall otherwise remains intact.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Armored Form (6 psi; conc., 1 min.).</b> As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, which lasts until your concentration ends.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Animate Earth (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> As an action, you cause an earth elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The elemental lasts until your concentration ends, and it obeys your verbal commands. In combat, roll for its initiative, and choose its behavior during its turns. When this effect ends, the elemental disappears. See the Monster Manual for its stat block.</p>

			<p>You imbue a ranged weapon with a strange semblance of sentience, allowing it to unerringly find its mark.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b>. While you are focused on this discipline, any attack roll you make for a ranged weapon attack ignores disadvantage. If disadvantage would normally apply to the roll, that roll also can’t benefit from advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Speed Dart (1–7 psi).</b> As a bonus action, you imbue one ranged weapon you hold with psionic power. The next attack you make with it that hits before the end of the current turn deals an extra 1d10 psychic damage per psi point spent.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Seeking Missile (2 psi).</b> As a reaction when you miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack roll against the same target.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Faithful Archer (5 psi; conc., 1 min.).</b> As a bonus action, you imbue a ranged weapon with a limited sentience. Until your concentration ends, you can make an extra attack with the weapon at the start of each of your turns (no action required). If it is a thrown weapon, it returns to your grasp each time you make any attack with it.</p>

			<p>You dispatch part of your psyche into the noosphere, the collective vista of minds and knowledge possessed by living things.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> Whenever you focus on this discipline, you choose one skill or tool and have proficiency with it until your focus ends. Alternatively, you gain the ability to read and write one language of your choice until your focus ends.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Wandering Mind (2–6 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> You enter a deep contemplation. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration, you then gain proficiency with up to three of the following skills (one skill for every 2 psi points spent): Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, and Survival. The benefit lasts for 1 hour, no concentration required.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Find Creature (2 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> You cast your mind about for information about a specific creature. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration, you then gain a general understanding of the creature’s current location. You learn the region, city, town, village, or district where it is, pinpointing an area between 1 and 3 miles on a side (DM’s choice). If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Item Lore (3 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> You carefully study an item. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration while remaining within 5 feet of the item, you then gain the benefits of an identify spell cast on that item.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Speech (5 psi).</b> As an action, you attune your mind to the psychic imprint of all language. For 1 hour, you gain the ability to understand any language you hear or attempt to read. In addition, when you speak, all creatures that can understand a language understand what you say, regardless of what language you use.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Wandering Eye (6 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> As an action, you create a psychic sensor within 60 feet of you. The sensor lasts until your concentration ends. The sensor is invisible and hovers in the air. You mentally receive visual information from it, which has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The sensor can look in all directions. As an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Phasing Eye (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> As Wandering Eye above, except the eye can move through solid objects but can’t end its movement in one. If it does so, the effect immediately ends.</p>

			<p>You exert your mind on the area around you, twisting the intraplanar pathways you perceive to allow instantaneous travel.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Psychic Focus.</b> After you teleport on your turn while focused on this discipline, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, as you are propelled by the magic of your teleportation. You can receive this increase only once per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Step of a Dozen Paces (1–7 psi).</b> If you haven’t moved yet on your turn, you take a bonus action to teleport up to 20 feet per psi point spent to an unoccupied space you can see, and your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Nomadic Anchor (1 psi).</b> As an action, you create an invisible, intangible teleportation anchor in a 5-foot cube you can see within 120 feet of you. For the next 8 hours, whenever you use this psionic discipline to teleport, you can instead teleport to the anchor, even if you can’t see it, but it must be within range of the teleportation ability.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Defensive Step (2 psi) .</b> When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to gain a +4 bonus to AC against that attack, possibly turning it into a miss. You then teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>There and Back Again (2 psi).</b> As a bonus action, you teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then move up to half your speed. At the end of your turn, you can teleport back to the spot you occupied before teleporting, unless it is now occupied or on a different plane of existence.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Transposition (3 psi).</b> If you haven’t moved yet on your turn, choose an ally you can see within 60 feet of you. As a bonus action, you and that creature teleport, swapping places, and your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn. This ability fails and is wasted if either of you can’t fit in the destination space.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Baleful Transposition (5 psi).</b> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you and that creature teleport, swapping places. This ability fails and is wasted if either of you can’t fit in the destination space.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Phantom Caravan (6 psi).</b> As an action, you and up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you teleport up to 1 mile to a spot you can see. If there isn’t an open space for all the targets to occupy at the arrival point, this ability fails and is wasted.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Nomad’s Gate (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.).</b> As an action, you create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you. You create an identical cube at any point of your choice within 1 mile that you have viewed within the past 24 hours. Until your concentration ends, anyone entering one of the cubes immediately teleports to the other one, appearing in an unoccupied space next to it. The teleportation fails if there is no space for the creature to appear in.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b>Precognitive Hunch (2 psi; conc., 1 min.).</b> As a bonus action, you open yourself to receive momentary insights that improve your odds of success; until your concentration ends, whenever you make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you roll a d4 and add it to the total.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>All-Around Sight (3 psi) .</b> In response to an attack hitting you, you use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack roll, possibly causing it to miss.</p>

On a failed save, the target takes the attack’s normal damage and suffers its additional effects. On a successful save, the target takes half damage from the attack but suffers no additional effects that would normally be imposed on a hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Lethal Strike (1–7 psi).</b> As a bonus action, you imbue a weapon you’re holding or your unarmed strike with psychic energy. The next time you hit with it before the end of your turn, it deals an extra 1d10 psychic damage per psi point spent.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Augmented Weapon (5 psi; conc., 10 min.).</b> As a bonus action, touch one simple or martial weapon. Until your concentration ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +3 bonus to its attack and damage rolls.</p>
