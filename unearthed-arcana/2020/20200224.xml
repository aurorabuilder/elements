		<description>
			<p>An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.</p>

			<p>Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your artificer magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of heavy armor you are wearing into power armor, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following benefits while wearing the power armor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the power armor lacks this requirement for you.</li>
				<li>You can use the power armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.</li>
				<li>The power armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, and it replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Infiltrator.</em></strong> You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Lightning Launcher.</strong> A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.</li>
				<li><strong>Powered Steps.</strong> Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Second Skin.</strong> The armor’s weight is negligible, and it becomes formfitting and wearable under clothing. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, the power armor doesn’t.</li>

			<p>An ancient lineage, the Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many druids of this circle keep detailed records of the stars and their effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore.

			<p>You can magically remove yourself from one creature’s perception: you gain a bonus action that you can use to force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can’t see or hear you for 24 hours. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of any turn during which you hit it with an attack roll, forced it to make a saving throw, or dealt damage to it. The effect ends early if you use this bonus action again. On a successful save, the target is immune to this feature for 7 days.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you’ve used this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to use it again.</p>
