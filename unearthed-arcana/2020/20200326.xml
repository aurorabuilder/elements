			<p>Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).</li>
				<li>You are immune to the poisoned condition (Lower Planes) or the charmed condition (Upper Planes).</li>
				<li>Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.</li>
				<li>You have a +2 bonus to AC.</li>
				<li>All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</li>
				<li>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</li>

			<p class="indent">Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 1d8 extra damage when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is radiant if the spirits are good and necrotic if they are evil. Any creature that takes this damage can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, any creature of your choice that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>

When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.</p>
			<p class="indent">If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you.</p>
