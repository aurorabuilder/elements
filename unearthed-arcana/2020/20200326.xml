			<p>Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).</li>
				<li>You are immune to the poisoned condition (Lower Planes) or the charmed condition (Upper Planes).</li>
				<li>Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.</li>
				<li>You have a +2 bonus to AC.</li>
				<li>All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.</li>
				<li>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Your attack rolls score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.</li>
				<li>When you score a critical hit against a creature, that target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.</li>

		<description>
			<p>This tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin where you want the tattoo to appear and speak the command word. The needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on your skin. Once the tattoo is on your skin, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.</p>
			<p class="indent">The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.</p>
