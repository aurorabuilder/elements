            <p>Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.</p>
            <p class="indent">These druids believe that life and death are portions of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death is not the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.</p>
            <p class="indent">Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. However, these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</p>

        <description>
            <p>The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic - a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.</p>
            <p class="indent">Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes, alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the magic-infused armore they don. The armor not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways.</p>
            <p class="indent">Wizards of this tradition are regarded as savants to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.</p>

        <p>Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane armor.</p>
        <p class="indent">Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor - a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.</p>
        <p class="indent">The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 12+your Dexterity modifier. It weighs 8 pounds. You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.</p>
        <!-- <p class="indent"><em>IMPORTANT: You must add the Arcanomechanical Armor to your character from the equipment section</em></p> -->

        <p>At 6th level, you learn to channel magic through your arcanomechanical armor to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell while wearing that armor and attuned to it, you can expend one additional spell slot of 1st or 2nd level to alter the spell. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.</p>
        <p class="indent">A 1st-level slot allows you to manipulate the spell's energy. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.</p>
        <p class="indent">A 2nd-level slot increases the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase that damage by 2d10 force damage against one of the spell's targets (your choice) this turn.</p>
