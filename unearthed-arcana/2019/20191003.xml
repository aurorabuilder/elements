			<p>The Twilight Domain governs the transition and blending of light into darkness. It is a time of rest and comfort, but also the threshold between safety and the unknown. Deities of healing or respite (such as Boldrei, Hestia, Mishakal, or Pelor), bravery or protection (such as Dol Arrah, Hajama, Helm, or Ilmater), travel or transition (such as Fharlanghn, Hermes, the Raven Queen, or the Traveler), or the night and dreams (such as Celestian, Morpheus, Nut, or Selûne) might grant their clerics the Twilight Domain. Clerics who serve these deities tend to be brave, delving into the dark to hold its dangers at bay and to bring comfort to those lost far from the light.</p>

		<supports>Arcane Tradition</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.</p>
			<p class="indent">That distinction creates power that onomancers seek to tap. By speaking a target’s true name, the wizard’s spells slip between the cracks of the target’s defenses, conforming to its essential nature through the power of its name. To protect themselves, wizards who follow this tradition often hide their true names, typically by adopting monikers and pseudonyms.</p>

				<h5>True Names</h5>
				<p>Onomancy, or naming magic, is a method of spellcasting that uses a creature’s true name to enhance a spell’s effects. A true name is the name by which a self-aware creature identifies itself. This name might be the name a person was given at birth, or one a person chose or earned later in life. Whatever a name’s origin, the simplest way for you to know your true name is to think truthfully about yourself and then think, “My name is …” Your true name is how you finish that sentence.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can try to hide your true name by using a pseudonym, but you must be wary not to inhabit that false name too deeply. If a false name comes to be the best expression of who you are, it becomes your true name. Changing one’s true name is never a quick choice; it’s something that happens over time as a name becomes the creature’s truth.</p>
				<p class="indent">As a quick guide, a creature has a true name if it understands at least one language or it has an alignment.</p>

			<p>You learn words of power called Resonants, which allow you to tailor your spells through the use of a target’s true name.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Resonants Known.</em></strong> When you gain this feature, you learn two Resonants of your choice, which are detailed in the “Resonant Options” section. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one resonant you know with a different one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Using a Resonant.</em></strong> You can use one Resonant when you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. Speaking the name is part of casting the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use Resonants a number of times equal to half of your wizard level (round down), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Resonant Options.</em></strong> Here are your options when choosing a Resonant:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Absorption.</strong> When you cast a spell that deals damage to the named target, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit points you gain increases by 1d6 when you reach 10th level (4d6) and 14th level (5d6) in this class.</li>
				<li><strong>Devastation.</strong> If the spell requires the named creature to make a saving throw, that creature has disadvantage on the first save it makes against the spell.</li>
				<li><strong>Dissolution.</strong> The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage. The extra force damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 10th level (3d8) and 14th level (4d8) in this class.</li>
				<li><strong>Nullification.</strong> If the named target is affected by any other spells, you know what those spells are, and you can attempt to end one of your choice by succeeding on an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spell.</li>
				<li><strong>Puppetry.</strong> The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, you can knock the creature prone or move it up to 10 feet, either directly toward you or away from you.</li>
				<li><strong>Sympathy.</strong> If the named creature is within range of the spell, you can target the creature with the spell even if you can’t see the creature or it has total cover against the spell.</li>
