			<p>In February, we presented a revised version of a new character class: the artificer, a master of magical invention. Today we return to that class, now with even more content! Here’s what’s been added:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New subclasses—the Archivist and the Battle Smith</li>
				<li>A revised spell list, including spells from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</li>
				<li>New infusions—Enhanced Wand, Repeating Shot, and Repulsion Shield</li>
				<li style="text-decoration: line-through">A revision to multiclassing—round up when determining spell slots</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’re considering various changes to the class, but we’d love to hear from you before we start the remodeling. With that in mind, we invite you to give this new version of the artificer a read and to try it out in play. Soon a survey will appear on the D&amp;D website. Please let us know in that survey what you think of the artificer.</p>

			<p>What are the best ways to store vast amounts of information? That question has occupied chroniclers and librarians for centuries. Scrolls and books were the finest information-storing methods for a long time, but the first Archivists imagined something greater: storing information in a real or an artificial mind. What library could match a mental archive capable of accessing information in seconds? As they work towards this goal, Archivists have become masters of storing knowledge and creating artificial intelligences fueled by magic. These techniques have yet to be perfected and institutionalized, and of all artificers, archivists are on the cutting edge of arcane science.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you discover how to awaken a mind inside an object. Whenever you finish a long rest and your calligrapher’s supplies are with you, you can magically rouse a keen mind within a Tiny, nonmagical object on which you write mystical symbols. The object is a magic item while the mind is inside it, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus. If you already have an artificial mind from this feature, the first one immediately dissipates.</p>
			<p class="indent">The magic item has the following properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Telepathic Advisor.</em></strong> The artificial mind telepathically supplies you with advice and information about certain topics: while the item is on your person, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice; the item’s main material determines which skills you can choose from, as shown on the Artificial Mind table in the Skill Proficiencies column, for the nature of the object affects the mind’s knowledge.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Manifest Mind.</em></strong> As a bonus action while the item is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral presence, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and invulnerable, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You determine its appearance; the Artificial Mind table offers suggested appearances based on the object’s main material.</p>
			<p class="indent">While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. As an action, you can hear and see using the mind’s senses, instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures but not objects. The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet away from its magic item or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast an artificer spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind’s space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (at least once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Information Overload.</em></strong> As an action while the item is on your person, you can try to magically overload the thoughts of one creature you or the mind can see that is within 5 feet of the manifested mind, channeling a jumble of information from the artificial mind. Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the next attack roll against it before the end of your next turn has advantage, since it is temporarily too distracted to defend itself well. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8) in this class.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you deal damage with this feature, you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than first.</p>

			<p>Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together if defenses fail. A combination of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert at defending others and repairing both material and personnel.

Many soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle Smith and an iron defender.</p>

			<p>By 3rd level, the tinkering in your free time has borne you a faithful companion, an iron defender. This metallic creature resembles a hound, a cougar, a bear, or another four-legged creature of your choice. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the iron defender stat block.</p>
			<p class="indent">In combat, the iron defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith’s tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The iron defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, you can create a new iron defender if you have your smith’s tools with you. If you already have an iron defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.</p>
