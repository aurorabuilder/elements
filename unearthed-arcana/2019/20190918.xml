			<p>Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more powerful than objective truth. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments, and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of entire audiences.</p>

		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Oath of Heroism is an affirmation of a destined path, one laid out for you by divine hands. For whatever reason, a god or a group of gods has included you in their machinations. You are not a reluctant hero, but one who fully embraces the idea that great deeds are yours to achieve. You train diligently, sculpting your body and refining your skills so you’re ready when destiny calls.</p>
			<h5>TENETS OF HEROISM</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Heroism reflect a paladin’s commitment to fulfilling their calling as a hero worthy of legend.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Actions over Words.</em></strong> Strive to be known by deeds not words.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Challenges Are but Tests.</em></strong> Every hardship serves to challenge your abilities and harden your resolve.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Embrace Destiny.</em></strong> You didn’t choose this path, but it’s yours to walk. And it will carry you into legend.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hone the Body.</em></strong> Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.</p>
