If you move beyond this range, the knowbot disappears in 2d4 rounds, as if the duration of the spell had expired. Moving within range again immediately reestablishes the bond.</p>
            <p class="indent">The knowbot is bound to the system in which it was created, and it stays there until it is dismissed or the spell's duration expires.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5rd level or higher, the spell's duration increases to 1 hour.

			<p>The creature you touch feels reality subtly shifted to its favor while this spell is in effect. The target isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays of any sort. Traffic light are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at the full speed through dense crowds, and attacks opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Synchronicity </i>grants advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks mode to drive a vehicle.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the event that two or more creatures under effect of synchronicity are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures engage in a contest of Charisma each time the effects of the spells would oppose each other.</p>

			<p>This spell allows you to bypass system security in order to create a secure login on a foreign system. The login you create allows you administrator-level privileges in any computer system not enhanced through technomagic. The login defeats any technomagic spells of 3rd level or lower.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the duration of the spell expires, the login and all privileges are wiped from the system. System logs still show the activity of the user, but the user identification cannot be found or traced.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you are able to bypass technomagic spells if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.</p>
