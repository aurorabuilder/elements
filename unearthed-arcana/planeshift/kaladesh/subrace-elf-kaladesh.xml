		<description>
			<p>Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh’s food supply is grown by elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane’s ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients. </p>
			<p class="indent">A garden tended by elves seems to grow naturally in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. In fact, many of the forests and plains of Kaladesh are planted and tended by elves as well. What might appear at first to be wild countryside is more likely a carefully planned landscape designed to meet the needs of the people and animals that live there.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive elves even exist.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Vahadar are elves who dwell in the cities of Kaladesh. They are comfortable with technology, and work as planners, architects, aether-seers, or inventors. Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways. The Vahadar are generally integrated into the rest of society on Kaladesh, living in cities dominated by the other races (though, as in Ghirapur, many of them live in specific garden-like neighborhoods) and engaging in trade.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrip. </i></b>You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
