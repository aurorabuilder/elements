			<p>Draconbloods possess long tails and a knack for social manipulation. They remember the days when they were once mighty conquerors.</p>
			<p class="indent">A draconblood uses the dragonborn traits in the Player’s Handbook, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score increase, and Damage Resistance traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Forceful Presence.</em></strong> You can use your understanding of creative diplomacy or intimidation to guide a conversation in your favor. When you make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this trait you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
