		<description>
			<p>The black blade of this sword is crafted from a mysterious arcane alloy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you are immune to effects that turn undead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dark Blessing.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Disheartening Strike.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it’s immune to the frightened condition. Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until the next dusk.</p>

	<element name="Arcane Cannon" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_ARCANE_CANNON">
		<description>
			<p>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Acid Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</li>
				<li><strong>Fire Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</li>
				<li><strong>Frost Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
				<li><strong>Lightning Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</li>
				<li><strong>Poison Spray.</strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

		<description>
			<p>If you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space). You have a number of hit points equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier. If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount. If you have any levels of exhaustion, reduce your level of exhaustion by 1. Once the ring is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed.</p>

	<element name="Spell Bottle" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_SPELL_BOTTLE">
		<description>
			<p>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This staff of polished gray wood bears numerous runes carved along its length. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into dust and is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: fortune’s favor (2 charges), pulse wave (3 charges), or gravity sinkhole (4 charges). See chapter 4 for descriptions of these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>New Possibility.</em></strong> If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against a spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
