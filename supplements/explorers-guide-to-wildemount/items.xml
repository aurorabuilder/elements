		<description>
			<p>The black blade of this sword is crafted from a mysterious arcane alloy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you are immune to effects that turn undead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dark Blessing.</em></strong> While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Disheartening Strike.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it’s immune to the frightened condition. Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until the next dusk.</p>

	<element name="Arcane Cannon" type="Magic Item" source="Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount" id="ID_WOTC_EGTW_MAGIC_ITEM_ARCANE_CANNON">
		<description>
			<p>This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Acid Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.</li>
				<li><strong>Fire Jet.</strong> The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</li>
				<li><strong>Frost Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
				<li><strong>Lightning Shot.</strong> The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.</li>
				<li><strong>Poison Spray.</strong> The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

		<description>
			<p>This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.</p>

Dyolets can also be imbued with minor healing abilities, a property kept secret by the gnomes of the Velvin Thicket until recent years. Herbalists and apothecaries can imbue healing within the fruit for a fraction of the time and gold cost of brewing a potion. A dyolet can be imbued with one of the following properties by a character proficient with a healer’s kit:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can saturate the fruit with carefully brewed curative draughts to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of healing. This process takes 12 hours and costs 15 gp.</li>
				<li>You can saturate the fruit with strengthened restorative properties to imbue a dyolet with the properties of a potion of greater healing. This process takes 4 days and costs 70 gp.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can consume a dyolet as an action to gain its healing effect. A dyolet lasts up to 20 days after being harvested before it begins to rot. A rotting dyolet loses its healing properties.</p>

			<p>This bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability to psychic damage, for 1 hour. For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1d6 hours and suffer the effects of a confusion spell for 1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the frightened condition for 1 hour.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance discovered throughout the wilds of the Miskath Strand. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the mouth of the Miskath Pit and found within smaller geode formations near sites ravaged by the Calamity. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain a round their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours. For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion-an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As an action, a creature can throw a vial of frigid woe up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact and releasing its contents as a cloud of spores. Each creature within 5 feet of the vial when it shatters must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract frigid woe (see the “Eiselcross” section of chapter 3).</p>
			<p class="indent">If a character has contracted frigid woe, track the number of days that have passed so you can inform the player when their character’s symptoms appear and when they need to make Constitution saving throws.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>Frigid Woe</h5>
				<p>Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor’s mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross’s ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.</p>
				<p class="indent">The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor’s mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature’s body. The infected creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature’s speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.</p>
				<p class="indent">A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.</p>

		<compendium display="false" />
		<description>
			<p>A weapon of Tharizdun, this dagger is a piece of jagged stone whose blade is scribed with a maze-like pattern with no beginning or end.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Blade of Broken Mirrors is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> An insane glabrezu named Ragazuu lives within the Blade of Broken Mirrors. The weapon yearns to cause chaos. It learns its wielder’s principles, then uses those ideals to encourage reckless action. The dagger whispers ideas of revolution.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The dagger grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand.</li>
				<li>Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature’s appearance.

				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
				<li>While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.</li>
				<li>While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>

		<description>
			<p>This mace has a haft of black iron and a ruby head with a fiendish countenance. Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The Mace of the Black Crown is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the Mace of the Black Crown. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder’s dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Infernal.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
				<li>While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace.</li>
				<li>While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When the mace reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra fire damage dealt by the weapon when it is ignited increases to 2d6.</li>
				<li>The weapon’s Summon Devil feature can also be used to summon a bearded devil.</li>
				<li>You have resistance to poison damage while holding this weapon.</li>

			<p>Black, blue, green, red, and white gems carved in the form of dragon heads cover this ostentatious gold war pick, marking it as a weapon channeling the power of Tiamat.</p>

				<li>As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute.
