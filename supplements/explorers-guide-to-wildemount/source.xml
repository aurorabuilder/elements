			<p><strong>Create your own Critical Role campaigns with this sourcebook for the world's greatest roleplaying game!</strong></p>
			<p>Explorer’s Guide to Wildemount provides everything you need to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons on the continent of Wildemount (set within the world of Exandria)—a land of war, betrayal, and swashbuckling adventure.</p>
			<p>Comprised of four regions, Wildemount provides endless potential for adventure in a land of brewing conflict and incredible magic. Rising tensions boil over into all-out war between the politically dubious Dwendalian Empire and the light-worshiping wastefolk of Xhorhas, supplying a vibrant backdrop for any D&amp;D campaign to explore.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Uncover a trove of new options usable in any D&amp;D game, featuring subclasses, spells, magic items, monsters, and more, rooted in the adventures of Critical Role—such as Vestiges of Divergence and the possibility manipulating magic of dunamancy.</li>
				<li>Start a campaign in any of Wildemount’s regions using a variety of introductory adventures, dozens of regional plot seeds, and the heroic chronicle system—a way to create character backstories rooted in Wildemount.</li>
				<li>Explore every corner of Wildemount and discover mysteries revealed for the first time by Critical Role Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer.</li>
			</ul>
