			<p>The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal’Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king’s authoritarian rule. Today, Tal’Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire.</p>			
			<p class="indent">You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creatures a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the “Ballad of the Grinning Fool” in a major tavern of inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM’s Discretion.</p>
			<p class="indent">This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.</p>
