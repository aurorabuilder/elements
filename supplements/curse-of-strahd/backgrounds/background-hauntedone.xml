        <description>
            <p>You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You’ve tried to bury it and flee from it to no avail. This thing that haunts you can’t be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from others and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose two from among Arcana, Investigation, Religion, and Survival</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Choose one exotic language (Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon)</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A monster hunter’s pack, a set of common clothes, and one trinket of special significance (see below), and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>HARROWING EVENT</h5>
            <p>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table.</p>
