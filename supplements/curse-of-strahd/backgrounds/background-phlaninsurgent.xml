        <description>
            <p>The taking of Phlan by Vorgansharax is a clear memory in your mind. You were going about your everyday business when the green dragon’s forces spilled out of the sewers and assailed your home. Many of Phlan’s citizens, young and old alike, were captured, killed, or offered as tribute to the Maimed Virulence. You, yourself were one of those captured. But, either with the help of adventurers or through your own wits and sheer determination, you escaped.</p>
            <p class="indent">Rather than flee the region, you’ve chosen to stay and fight. Finding refuge outside the town and the deadly thicket surrounding it, you strike out against the Tears of the Virulence and their monstrous allies. You’ve learned to survive in dire and desperate circumstances, with supplies running low and the arrival of reinforcements uncertain. You’ve grown accustomed to acting under the cover of night, dealing what blows you can to avenge the friends and family you lost within the currently occupied Phlan. You will drive Vorgansharax out, or you die trying.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Skill Proficiencies: </b>Stealth, Survival<br/>
                <b>Tool Proficiencies: </b>One type of artisan’s tools, vehicles (land)<br/>
                <b>Equipment: </b>A bag of caltrops (20), a small trinket that connects you to the life you once had before the occupation of Phlan, a healer’s kit, a set of dark common clothes that includes a cloak and hood, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp.
            </p>
            <h5>Origin</h5>
            <p>Removed from your life as a townsperson, you’ve adapted to rough life in the wilds surrounding Phlan. The trade you practiced still influences your outlook, the manner in which you approach situations, and the way you contribute to the resistance movement against the Maimed Virulence. You can roll on the following table to determine what your occupation was before the fall, or choose one that best fits your character (select from either the general column or the specific column, but not both).</p>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>You have given up the life you knew as a citizen of Phlan. However, the Maimed Virulence’s invasion resonates deep inside you. Perhaps you have a few friends or family members who were able to escape with you. Or, perhaps, everyone you held dear either perished or went missing during the fall. You may know of someone who is, against all odds, surviving within the thicket and you long to liberate them from a life of peril within the town.</p>

            <p>You’ve come to know the surrounding forests, streams, caves, and other natural features in which you can take refuge or set up ambushes. You can quickly survey your environment for advantageous features. Additionally, you can scavenge around your natural surroundings to cobble together simple supplies (such as improvised torches, rope, patches of fabric, etc.) that are consumed after use.</p>
