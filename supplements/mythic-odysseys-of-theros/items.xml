			<p>You were forged in the fires of Purphoros’s forge. Your appearance bears a metallic sheen and visible joints. The Anvilwrought Characteristics table suggests details of your life or origins. Additionally, you gain the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Constructed Resilience.</em></strong> You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
				<li>You are immune to disease.</li>
				<li>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry’s Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>

		<description>
			<p>No one can deny the reality of the gods of Theros, whose presence and deeds are visible in the night sky and sometimes directly in the mortal realm. But some people refute the idea that the gods are worthy of reverence. Such iconoclasts are common among the leonin, but members of any culture can adopt this supernatural gift. The Iconoclast Characteristics table presents suggestions for why you’ve become an iconoclast.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your denial of the gods gives you supernatural power to resist their influence in the world. You gain the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Enlightened Protection.</em></strong> You can cast protection from evil and good with this trait, targeting only yourself and requiring no material components. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this trait.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reject the Gods.</em></strong> You can’t gain or lose piety to any god. You instead gain the following traits at the character level listed in each one. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for any spell that you cast through these traits.</p>
			<h4>ICONOCLAST HERO</h4>
			<p><em>5th-level Iconoclast trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast dispel magic with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h4>ICONOCLAST PARAGON</h4>
			<p><em>11th-level Iconoclast trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast dispel evil and good with this trait, requiring no material components. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you cast dispel magic using your Iconoclast Hero trait, you cast it as a 4th-level spell.</p>
			<h4>ICONOCLAST ARCHETYPE</h4>
			<p><em>17th-level Iconoclast trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast antimagic field with this trait, requiring no material components. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you cast dispel magic using your Iconoclast Hero trait, you cast it as a 5th-level spell.</p>

			<p>Like a sphinx, you have a mind like a maze, impenetrable to mortal scrutiny. This might be a gift or training from an actual sphinx, the blessing (or curse) of a god, or an inexplicable talent. The Inscrutable Characteristics table suggests options for what makes you inscrutable. Additionally, you gain the following trait.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Psychic Shield.</em></strong> You have resistance to psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sphinx’s Shroud.</em></strong> You are immune to any effect that allows other creatures to sense your emotions or read your thoughts. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Behind many heroes is another hero whose greatness comes from the support and love they offer. Haktos had his beloved Perynes, Renata was accompanied by her servant Karados, and Siona sailed with her devoted crew. Like these partners, you are great and make others great. Consider the Companion Relationships table when determining your legendary connection. Any relationship with another player’s character requires that player’s consent. Additionally, you gain the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Boon Aura.</em></strong> Your allies within 5 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed, provided you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Companion’s Protection.</em></strong> When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to cause the attack to hit you instead. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

	<element name="Nyxborn" type="Magic Item" source="Mythic Odysseys of Theros" id="ID_WOTC_MOOT_MAGIC_ITEM_GIFT_NYXBORN">
		<description>
			<p>Born from the minds of the gods, the creatures that populate the gods’ realm are called Nyxborn. Nyxborn creatures resemble mortal beings, but philosophers debate their true character. Are they idealized forms of mortal beings, free from the imperfections and transience that causes mortals to suffer and die? Or are they hollow and soulless shades, lacking the authenticity and pathos that make mortal existence worthwhile?</p>
			<p class="indent">A Nyxborn is like a fragment of divinity, an idea or a dream that is incarnate. You embody an idea—like the way leaves turn toward the sun or the feeling of ocean sand between the toes, the way the heart stirs when the tide of battle changes or the sadness that lingers when remembering a happy moment of childhood.</p>
			<p class="indent">These ideas, dreams, memories, and feelings are the stuff Nyx is made of, and a Nyxborn is shaped from that raw material. You might have been specifically crafted by one of the gods to serve a certain purpose. Or your existence could be an accident caused by a confluence of supernatural forces. The Nyxborn Origin table offers a handful of suggestions that might explain how you came to be, and the Nyxborn Quirks table describes some special effects that might linger around your person.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you gain the following traits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cloak of Stars.</em></strong> As an action, you wrap yourself in a starry cloak, appearing like a silhouette formed of the night sky. When you do, attack rolls have disadvantage against you. This cloak lasts for 1 minute, until you doff it (no action required), or until you die. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nyxborn Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.</p>

	<element name="Oracle" type="Magic Item" source="Mythic Odysseys of Theros" id="ID_WOTC_MOOT_MAGIC_ITEM_GIFT_ORACLE">
		<description>
			<p>You possess a precious gift coveted not just by mortals but by the gods themselves: the gift of clear communication between the mortal and divine realms. As an oracle, you can perceive the whims of the gods and petition them for glimpses of their vast insight. This gift also comes with a curse, though, which typically takes the form of dire insights. Consult the Oracle Curse table to determine what unwanted revelations you receive.</p>
			<p class="indent">The gods seek mortal oracles to act as their agents. As a result, most oracles devote themselves to the service of a single god and learn to ignore the voices of all others. Occasionally, two gods agree to share the services of an oracle. Oracles who try to remain independent often find themselves pursued by the agents of evil gods who would bind them to the god’s service, if necessary.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain the following traits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ears of the Oracle.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Celestial, the language of the gods. In addition, a god might deliver a message through you, and you can decide whether to use your own voice or to allow the god’s voice to come through your mouth to deliver the message, translated into any language you speak.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Oracle’s Insight.</em></strong> The gods give you flashes of insight that help you bring your efforts to fruition. When you make an ability check, you can roll a d10 and add the number rolled to the check. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to add the d10, but you must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Oracle’s Piety.</em></strong> Your oracular abilities improve as your piety score increases. Instead of gaining the piety benefits associated with any god (as described in chapter 2), you gain the following traits when you reach the specified piety score.</p>
			<p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for any spell that you cast through these traits.</p>
			<h4>AUGUR</h4>
			<p><em>Piety 3+ Oracle trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast augury as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h4>SEER</h4>
			<p><em>Piety 10+ Oracle trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast divination as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h4>SIBYL</h4>
			<p><em>Piety 25+ Oracle trait</em></p>
			<p>You can cast commune as a ritual with this trait. Once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You also can’t be surprised, provided you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
			<h4>DIVINE ORACLE</h4>
			<p><em>Piety 50+ Oracle trait</em></p>
			<p>You can increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 2, as well as increasing your maximum for the chosen score by 2.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Purphoros’s hammer works wonders and disasters, the god of the forge using it to craft ground-breaking marvels and dangerous inventions in equal measure. Purphoros rarely bestows Akmon on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus. When Purphoros does permit a mortal to use the hammer, it’s usually so they might bring an important work into being, wreck a force of destruction, or forge something remarkable somewhere the god isn’t welcome.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hammer of the Forge.</em></strong> This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessing of the Forge.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Purphoros, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> The hammer has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>
				<li><strong>Piety 25+.</strong> The hammer has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
				<li><strong>Piety 50+.</strong> The hammer has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
			</ul><br/>
			<p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Purphoros, the hammer has 2 randomly determined minor detrimental properties.</p>
			<p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reforged.</em></strong> While holding the hammer, you have resistance to fire damage and are immune to exhaustion. Additionally, you have proficiency with smith’s tools and have advantage on all ability checks made using them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): animate objects, heat metal, fabricate, magic weapon, mending, shatter. Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, the spell can’t be cast again from it until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Hammer.</em></strong> To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Thassa wields Dekella, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Purphoros. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it’s often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she’d prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bident of the Deep.</em></strong> Thassa’s signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessing of the Deep.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet.</li>
				<li><strong>Piety 25+.</strong> The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>
				<li><strong>Piety 50+.</strong> The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
			</ul><br/>
			<p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined.</p>
			<p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Command the Deep.</em></strong> The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can cast the dominate monster spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Aquatic Metamorphosis.</em></strong> You can cast the true polymorph spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Bident.</em></strong> To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Nylea wields the shortbow Ephixis, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bow of the Wild.</em></strong> This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon’s long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessing of the Wild.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> The bow has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>
				<li><strong>Piety 25+.</strong> The bow has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
			</ul><br/>
			<p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property.</p>
			<p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Arrows of the Seasons.</em></strong> The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it’s used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spring.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Summer.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Autumn.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the wall of thorns spell there.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Winter.</em></strong> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the ice storm spell there.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Bow.</em></strong> The bow can’t be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it’s typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spear of the Sun.</em></strong> This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blessing of the Sun.</em></strong> If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>

				<li><strong>Piety 10+.</strong> The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>

			<p class="indent">If you aren’t a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.</p>
			<p class="indent">See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on randomly determined properties.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Luminous.</em></strong> The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sun’s Retaliation.</em></strong> When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: guiding bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Spear.</em></strong> If taken to Erebos’s palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos’s service.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Erebos wields Mastix, a whip capable of extending like an impossibly long shadow. In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Erebos grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it’s typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Heliod.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Whip of the Dead.</em></strong> Erebos’s whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can’t be used again until the next dusk.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Erebos’s Claim.</em></strong> While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either circle of death or dominate monster (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dusk.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Whip.</em></strong> To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month.</p>
