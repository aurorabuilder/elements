			<p>Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Tenets of Glory</h5>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Actions over Words.</em></strong> Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Challenges Are but Tests.</em></strong> Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hone the Body.</em></strong> Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Discipline the Soul.</em></strong> You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.</p>

			<p>You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Peerless Athlete.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Inspiring Smite.</em></strong> Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.</p>
