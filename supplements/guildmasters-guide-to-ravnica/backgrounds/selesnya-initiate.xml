			<p>You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully. living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat’Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds- with military force if necessary.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers-the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic. and generally peaceful-unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community.</p>
