		<description>
			<p>The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist-the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways-attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Animal Handling, Athletics</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Herbalism kit</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Choose one of Draconic, Giant, Goblin, or Sylvan</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A Gruul insignia, a hunting trap, an herbalism kit, the skull of a boar, a beast-hide cloak, a set of travelers clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.</p>

			<p>You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.</p>
