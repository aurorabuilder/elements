		<description>
			<p>You are a member of a teeming horde-one small part of a sprawling organism. Just as you are part of the swarm, the swarm is part of a larger ecosystem, a never-ending cycle of life, death, rot, and rebirth. You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Nature, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Poisoner’s kit</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Choose one of Elvish, Giant, or Kraul</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A Golgari insignia, a poisoner’s kit, a pet beetle or spider, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp worth of mixed coins</li>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death’s inevitable approach.</p>
