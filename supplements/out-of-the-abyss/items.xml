			<p>Lost for ages in the Underdark, <em>Dawnbringer</em> appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. Whi1e grasping the hilt you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. <em>Dawnbringer</em> has all the properties of a <em>sun blade</em>.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding the weapon. vou an use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> <em>Dawnbringer</em> is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you're attuned to it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> Forged by ancient sun worshipers, <em>Dawnbringer</em> is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Long years lost in darkness have made <em>Dawnbringer</em> frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.</p>

			<p>A spell gem can contain one spell from any class’s spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gems properties. While holding the gem. you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your classs spell list. Doing so doesn’t require any components and doesn’t require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each spell gem has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gems rarity and the stored spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as shown in the Spell Gem table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can imbue the gem with a spell if you’re attuned to it and it’s empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell’s level must be no higher than the gems maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed. you must provide them, but they can be worth half as much as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once imbued with a spell. the gem can’t be imbued again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Created by the stone giant librarians of Gravenhollow, this nineteen-inch long shard of quartz grants you advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks while it is on your person.</p>
			<p class="indent">The crystal has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: speak with animals (2 charges). speak with dead (4 charges), or speak with plants (3 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast a divination spell, you can use the crystal in place of one material component that would normally be consumed by the spell, at a cost of 1 charge per level of the spell. The crystal is not consumed when used in this way.</p>
			<p class="indent">The crystal regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the crystals last charge. roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal vanishes, lost forever.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature wilhin 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting ability) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.</p>
			<p class="indent">Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as docs the application of <em>oil of etherealness</em> or <em>universal solvent</em>. The glob also dissolves instantly itexposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand's last charge. roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <em>wand of viscid globs</em> is destroyed if exposed to sun light for 1 hour without interruption.</p>
