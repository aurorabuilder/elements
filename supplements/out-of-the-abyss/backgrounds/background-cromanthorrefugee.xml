			<p>You are one of hundreds of refugees that were driven from their homes after the kingdom committed itself toward the genocide of magic. Whether or not you were a magic user, had some small talent, or were simply hunted due to events relative to you, you are seen as filth towards those following the king’s propaganda. Royal guards make it very apparent at every opportunity to harass you, but should you stand up against them, you will shine like a beacon to any seeking light.</p>

			<p>You, and many like you, have suffered greatly. You bear a look of constant stress and exhaustion, though some may recognize this expression for its true meaning. Any who recognize your troubles may give you basic essentials, such as a roof for a night, or even useful information. These people are far and between, however, and you are more likely to pick up the attention of party’s associated with magic, for better or worse.</p>
