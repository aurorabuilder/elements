			<p>Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables below. A table’s title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the tables, an item’s entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the item’s description in the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more information about it, including the type of object required for its making.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you have Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, you can choose from among the common magic items in that book when you pick a magic item you can replicate with this infusion.</p>
