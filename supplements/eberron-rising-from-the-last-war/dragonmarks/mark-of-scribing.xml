		<description>
			<p>The Mark of Scribing deals with communication-both the written and spoken word. A gnome who bears the mark can feel words as though they are living creatures, struggling to make their meaning known. The mark provides a range of gifts. It translates languages, but it also allows its bearer to communicate with others at a distance.</p>
			<p>If you’re a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you have this subrace, with the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gifted Scribe.</em></strong> When you make an Intelligence (History) check or an ability check using calligrapher’s supplies, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Scribe’s Insight.</em></strong> You know the message cantrip. You can also cast comprehend languages once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the magic mouth spell with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells of the Mark.</em></strong> If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Scribing Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.</p>
