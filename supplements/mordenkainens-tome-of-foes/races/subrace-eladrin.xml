        <description>
			<p>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated witb one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin’s mood:</p>
			<p><b>Autumn</b> is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer’s harvest is shared with all.<br/>
			<b>Winter</b> is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.<br/>
			<b>Spring</b> is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter’s sorrow passes.<br/>
			<b>Summer</b> is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.</p>
			<p>Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin’s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.</p>
			<p class="indent">The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.</p>
