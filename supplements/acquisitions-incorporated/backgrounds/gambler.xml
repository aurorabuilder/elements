			<p>All you need to make a lot of gold is a little gold. Except at those times when all you need to have no gold at all is a little gold. Whether you’re a good gambler or a bad one rarely matters, because no one can divine the whims of Lady Luck. Sometimes you’re up, sometimes you’re down. But the thing about gambling is that someone is always willing to take a bet.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Some gamble out of necessity. Others do so out of boredom. Still others become addicted to the thrill of winning or losing everything on a turn of fortune. For some, gambling is less a matter of chance and more a matter of seeking every advantage to ensure the outcome. The best gamblers can lose everything, and the worst gamblers sometimes win. Regardless, you can always tell gamblers by the look in their eyes. Lady Luck haunts them.</p>
