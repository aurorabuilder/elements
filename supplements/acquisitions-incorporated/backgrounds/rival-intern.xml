		<description>
			<p>You were an intern at a rival of Acquisitions Incorporated, and you gained a healthy respect for not just the job and the franchising opportunities, but for the ruthless and efficient way Acquisitions Incorporated goes about its business. Why deal with the rest, when you can work for the best?</p>
			<p class="indent">Perhaps the rival did not treat you as well as you were hoping, or you washed out of that organization. Maybe you hope to leverage the knowledge you gained there for an advantage at Acquisitions Incorporated. Either way, you’re now bringing your talents to the company, ready to put your skills to use.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> History, Investigation</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of artisan’s tools</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Any one of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> One set of artisan’s tools, a ledger from your previous employer containing a small piece of useful information, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>If you were happy with your previous internship, the parting of ways might have been amicable. If not, it might have involved armed guards removing you from the premises. If you were passed over at your previous position, it might have left you a blend of seething rage, practiced nonchalance, and keen knowledge of where the bodies are buried (perhaps literally).</p>
