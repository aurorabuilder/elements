			<p>You’re tightly connected with the religious community of Baldur’s Gate. You know if a deity has a following in the city and any places that faith openly congregates and the neighborhoods those faithful typically inhabit. While this isn’t remarkable for most of the city’s larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.</p>

			<p>You’re well-versed in the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Baldurian patriars and other nobles, imitating them smoothly enough to convince even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You’re skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur’s Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you’re patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your deception.</p>

			<p>In Baldur’s Gate, crime is just another business. As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or—certainly— the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion take your information on request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.</p>

			<p>You’ve learned that most of the real business of entertainment (or any other venture) happens behind the scenes. It’s easy for you to case what sorts of audiences attend what venue—like how toughs gather at the Blushing Mermaid or how brash patriars congregate at the Helm and Cloak. After a successful performance, you may meet an enthusiastic member of the crowd—someone of an occupation or social class that frequents the establishment. This contact is delighted to talk with you, and to listen.</p>

			<p>You’ve lived your entire life in the Lower or Outer City of Baldur’s Gate. You grew up seeing arrogant patriars flaunt their wealth while your hardworking neighbors struggled. As a result, you know how eager commoners in Baldur’s Gate are to see any patriar get what they deserve. While in a busy part of the Lower City or Outer City of Baldur’s Gate, you can spend 2d10 minutes to convince 1d6 <strong>commoners</strong> to perform a non-illegal act that inconveniences a member of the Watch or Flaming Fist, a patriar, or some other wealthy looking individual.</p>

This is the district where you conduct most of your business. Whenever you need information about something in one of that district’s neighborhoods, you can seek out crew members in that area and learn the local gossip. You can also gain unimpeded entry to nearly any bank, guild hall, place of business, workhouse, or crew meeting place in your district.</p>

			<p>You know the Baldur’s Gate most Baldurians ignore, the dog-eat-dog world of the homeless and unfortunate. You know where to go inside the Lower City, and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn’t comfortable, but it’s unlikely anyone will find you—and you can stay as long as you want.</p>

			<p>As a member of one of the elite families of Baldur’s Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate’s nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others’ without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you—at least until you make some effort to expose it.</p>

As a result, it’s easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of to operate the city’s mechanized cranes.</p>

			<p>You may choose to currently serve in either the Flaming Fist or the Watch. If you do, you have responsibilities related to your post. For as long as you perform these responsibilities, you gain benefits. If you stop performing your responsibilities, though, you lose access to the benefits and might suffer further fallout. Should you lose these benefits, you main regain them by having an unpleasant conversation with your commanding officer and fulfilling your responsibilities for a month.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flaming Fist.</em></strong> If you serve in the Flaming Fist, once every ten days, you must report to the Seatower of Balduran for training, and you’re required to take a regular shift patrolling either the Lower City or the Outer City. In return, you have access to the Flaming Fist’s fortresses and a direct line of communication with Flaming Fist officers and other soldiers. You can also pass through the city’s gates without question—although you can’t bring guests into the Upper City as a member of the Watch might. Additionally, you’re always welcome as the Three Old Kegs, where the Three Old Toads are glad to greet you with a smile and a mug of ale.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>The Watch.</em></strong> If you serve in the Watch, you’re required to conduct a regular patrol in the Upper City or take a regular shift at its gates, and you must report for training in the Watch Citadel once every ten days. In return, you have access to the Citadel and a direct line of communication with Watch officers and officials. Your word carries considerable weight in the High Hall, and most establishments in the Citadel Streets neighborhood are happy to give you and your friends free meals. Additionally, you can escort people into the Upper City without question, regardless of whether they are patriars or have Watch tokens. Outside the Upper City, however, most people regard you with suspicion, and you generally get a chilly reception while in uniform.</p>

			<p>You’ve had enough dealings with crooked soldiers that you can spot the behaviors common to corrupt guards and military officers a mile away. While awareness of such corruption doesn’t equate to evidence of it, and your sense certainly isn’t foolproof, your instinct proves a useful starting point when determining who might take a bribe, who might turn a blind eye to a crime, or who might have criminal connections. You can also use this sense to get a feeling about who might fulfill their duties strictly by the book.</p>
