		<description>
			<p>You were trained for battle on sandy beaches and rocky shores. You have launched midnight raids from swift ships whose names evoke terror in the hearts of your adversaries. The water is your second home, the rain your shelter, and the crashing waves your battle cry.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Vehicles (water, land)</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of your ship or company, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>HARDSHIP ENDURED</h5>			
			<p>Hardship in your past has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that bests fits your character.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d6</td><td>Hardship</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Nearly Drowned.</strong> You hid underwater to avoid detection by enemies and held your breath for an extremely long time. Just before you would have died, you had a revelation about your existence.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Captured.</strong> You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Sacrifice.</strong> You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may thing you’re dead.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Juggernaut.</strong> No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Stowaway.</strong> For days, you hid in the bilge of an enemy ship, surviving on brackish water and foolhardy rats. At the right moment, you crept up to the deck and took over the ship on your own.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Leave None Behind.</strong> You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Marines are looked up to by other soldiers and respected by their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.</p>

Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.</p>
